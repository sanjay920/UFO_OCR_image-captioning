Dear Sir,

Report of Unidentified Flying Object

Please find encloaed UFO report from—
Thie report was initialli relayed to ATC Dunefold by —

fiancee who is 1! employee at Dunsfold. It was not
passed by telephone to AIS Military as I considered the time delay from
observation to receipt of the report at Dunsfold would not constitute an
'imediate' report.

The Dunsfold radar controller on duty at the time of the reported
observation does not recall seeing anything unusual on radar in the
vicinity of Horsham at the appropriate time.
