PHOTOGRAPHS
Reference:
A. D/DAAC/23/GA dated 6 Aug 85

1. Film's taken at the site were sent to CS (Rep 5) Photography with instructions
to forward prints and negatives on to you as requested, and a request that copies
be sent to me to return to the photographer. The copies had not arrived b' the
time I went on leave, so I left instructions that they be delivered to—

if they arrived in my absence. They did, and they were. Regretably CS (Rep S)

had posted the whole consignment to this address and nothing to you.

2. I have visited-and obtained the negatives and the few remaining
black and white prints, all of which are enclosed.

3. My 35 mm photographs are fairly indifferent, however his 55 mm colour ones,
are very good and give excellent detail both from the air and close to on the
ground.

N. I trust this is what you want, I would be grateful for the return of the
55 mm negatives in due course.
