. I
I have to report that at 21.37 hours Sunday 7 July 1985 I was
at Sowerby Bridge Police Station when I received a report by
telephone from aSection 40 born 22.12.15 of Section 40
Section 40 Rishworth that at between 2 50 am and 3.10 am on Sunday
7 July 1985 he saw in an easterly direction from his house, at
an altitude of 50 above the horizon a strong white light which
he said was flickering and was travelling in a southerly direction
towards Manchester.

I suggested to him that this may have been a sighting of an aircraft
but he insisted that this was not the case. I therefore respectfully
suggest that this report be forwarded to the Force HQ for the

attention of Chief Superintendent, Admin and that he may feel

it worthy of being passed to the Ministry of Defence Department

54? (Air), Main Building, Whitehall, London SW1A 2HB for their
information.
