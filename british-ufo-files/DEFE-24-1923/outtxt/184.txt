Dear Sir,
I enclose a statement from —of Pencader,

Dyfed regarding a U.F.O. sighting which she made on l6th February l985
and also on the following night.

 

However I am not asking for any classified information to be
divulged to me, but I would just like to reassure
that they did in fact see something that was not a natural p enomenon
(aurora, heavenly body etc.) but that whatever it was, it did not originate
from a foreign country or indeed from outer space!

I would only add that the_ are old friends of many
years standing, and are most reliable and level-headed witnesses.

I would be most grateful for any reassurances along the above
lines that can be given to me.

Yours faithfully,
