Sowerby Bridge

Chief Superintendent - 40

I have to report that at 21.37 hours Sunday 7 July 1985 I was
at Sowerby Bridge Police Station when I received a report by

from a -)born 22.12.15 of

Rishworth, that at between 2.50 am and 3.10 am on Sunday
7 July 1985 he sgw in an easterly direction from his house, at
an altitude of 5 above the horizon a strong white light which
he said was flickering and was travelling in a southerly direction
towards Manchester.

I suggested to him that this may have been a sighting of an aircraft
but he insisted that this was not the case. I therefore respectfully
suggest that this report be forwarded to the Force HQ for the

attention of Chief Superintendent, Admin and that he may feel

it worthy of being passed to the Ministry of Defence Department

54? (Air), Main Building, Whitehall, London SW1A 2H8 for their
information.
