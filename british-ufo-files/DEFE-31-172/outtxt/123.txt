LORDS DEBATE ON UFOs : 1.81:}! JANUARY 1979

Thank you for your minutes D/Sh(Air)/8/3 of 15th and 16th
January forwarding a revised draft of the speech for
Lord Strabolgi and additional background information
respectively.

2. I have discussed the revised speech with Lord Strabolgi
and have made further ~ largely editorial ~ amendments.
I attach a copy of a letter which I handed to Lord Strabolgi
last night together with a fresh copy of the speech itself.
Lord Strabolgi will be reading the speech again today and
will let me know as soon as possible whether he wishes to have
the briefing meeting which you and Section 40 have pencilled
in for 1130 tomorrow. ' i

3. You might like to know that the debate is causing a fair
amount of interest in the House of Lords. In addition to the_
Earl of Clancarty others taking part will include (in the
following order) Lord Trefgarne, the Earl of Kimberley,'
Viscount St Davids, Lords Rankeillour, Kings~Norton, Gladwyn
and Hewlett, the Bishop of Norwich, Earl Halsbury and

Viscount Oxfuird (who will be making his maiden speech).

4. We Will not know for certain when the UFO debate will
start. It depends, of course, on how long the earlier
business takes, but it is unlikely to start before 1800. We
will keep in touch with the House of Lords throughout the
course of tomorrow afternoon and early evening and we will
let you know as soon as we are needed. The debate is likely
to last for between two and three hours.
