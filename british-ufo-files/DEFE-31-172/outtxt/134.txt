9. ' In sum, we cannot prove that all or even most or these so-
called sightings were not UFOs. But we can say that there is a

great variety of phenomena in the skies for which there are .

-perfectly ordinary explanations. We have no reason to believe

that the so—called UFOs are attributed to anything but these same
causes. . . ' ‘ '

10. But what of these famous arrivals of UFOs, claimed to be
fully documented and authenticated by many witnesses. On
scrutiny they tend to he elusive. I will select one, which
Lord Clancarty has described in his book mysterious Visitors
as 'one of the most remarkable and unexplained mysteries of
modern times'. He claims that during the Gallipot; campaign
in 1315, an entire British regiment, the First Fourth Norfolks,
was advancing towards Hill 60: a cloud descended and picked up
the regiment and it was never heard of again ....... (checking
with Army Historical Branch)

11. As I have indicated,there is no criticism of those who

accurately report phenomena. The criticism is of over-readiness
to call them SUFOs', and to transpose that into 'alien space
craft'. The reports aﬁampassed without critical scrutiny to
the urologists; who addé without critical scrutiny, to their
huge files of 'reported sightings and landings'.
