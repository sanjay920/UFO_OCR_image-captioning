MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE

UNCLASSIFIED

. . UFOs - DRAFT CLOSING ADDRESS

There are three grains of truth upon which the great

myth of ufology is built.

FIRST: intelligent life could exist elsewhere in the
universe. With 100,000 million stars in our own
galaxy alone, it is probable that there are many

- planets capable of supporting life.

SECOND: the technical difficulties of inter—stellar

travel are stunning.§yen at the speed of light

. it would take 4 years to reach the nearest star,
and 100,000 years to cross our galaxy. But it
would be a brave man who said there could never,
ever,be manned inter—stellar travel.

THIRD: there really are strange phenomena in the skies,
and many are reported by cool and intelligent

. peOple.

2. But it is a far cry from this to the preposition that there
have been great numbers of sightings of UFOs — implying alien space
craft — sometimes claimed as running into hundreds of thousands.
Her majesty's Government is not in the least impressed with the
idea that there_is anything worth investigating in the information
offered by ufologists.
3.‘ 0n the one hand, there are perfectly simple explanations
for the phenomena: on the other, the explanations offered by
ufologists are most unconvincing. These explanations are un~
. convincing when they relate to Space craft from other stars: they
‘ are even more unconvincing when they claim that UFOs come from
another epacemtimeuﬁmmnsﬁvx) from a hole in the earth, or the

ldepths of the sea, as Lord Clancarty has suggested.
