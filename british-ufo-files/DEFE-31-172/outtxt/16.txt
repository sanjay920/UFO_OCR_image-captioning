The Earl of Cork and Orrer'y: My lords, I beg, leave
to asl: the Question which Stands 111 my name on the
Order Paper.
The Question was as follows:

To asl1lle1 M 1:1j1.‘sty s Gorernm e111 hown1any of
the 2 ,250 sightings of Ul Os reported to the Ministlv
of Defcne in the \ears ]9 7S- 8] were, and s: ill are
classiﬁed for reasons of security.

Viscount Long: None, my Lords.

The Earl of Cork and ()rrery: My Lords. I thank my
noble kinsman for that Answer. May i ask him two
questions? First, what. did he mean when he said in
his Answer 011, l thin. 41h March that reports of

sightings that were considered to be of interest to.

defence were in fact classiﬁed? Secondly, what pro-
cedures may be open to irrdividrrals or organisations:
who would like to see the. reports?

Viscount long: My [-,ords with regard to the latter
part olmy noble f1 rend s supplementary question. there
is no reason “11y he should not come and see the reports.
Not many of them come in because not many people
actually rcportsightings. There is no cover up 111 that

espeet. 'As tor the tirst part of my no‘olc friend’s
supplementary question, I stick to what i said earlier.

The Earl of Kimberley: My Lords, can my noble.
friend sav wlt)‘,. when I previously asked a supple
mentary question he said that the figures lad got lost
on the way to the Miniszry, \rhereas today he says that
they are there and available for anyone to see? Can
he therefore place them in the Library for all of 115
to see?

Viscount Long: My Lords, I will look into that and
ﬁnd out whether it is possible for your Lordships to
see them. I should like. all of year Lordships to see
'them in the Library, il‘ possible.

' Lord Struhol gi: My Lords, may I ask the Govern-
ment whether they think the. any of these UFOs 2111-.

solar system, as is believed by the “ tifologists "9

bellow; that; anything is possible.

and other reasons it is not prepared to maltc an

Viscount Long: No. my Lords, it is not prepared to
maltc an announcement because it has not got the fact:

Lord Besrriek: My Lords, the Question asks about
2,250 sightings. The noble Viscount says that there are
very few sightings reported to the Ministry 01 De lcnec
Does that mean to say that the figure 1n the Question is
incorrect '.’

Viscount 2.011;, '1'. No, my Lords it \ as on the original
assirmption that there are probably? rrrar'ry sightings
that are, not reported to the Ministry Defence That
is what I was really referring, to. 'llrer""tlore, at this
st'rgenhatwe hares; ridisthatwehavcgot.

Lord Besrrick: My Lords, l should like to clear 11p
that point. The Question refers to 2,250 sirgh tings
“ reported " to the Ministry of Defence. The Question
I was asked was, “ Is that ﬁgure correct. or not? ”

Viscount Long: That is correct, my Lords, up to this
rrroment.
