Meteorological searchlights shine on clouds: you cannot

see the beam, only a light apparently dancing in the
sky.

A surpriSing number of reports relate to aircraft seen in

'unusual cenditions at unusual angles, some very high, some

at low level. One recent 'UFOl was confidently reported

on local radio: we cannot prove that it was not a 'UFO', but
so do know that an RAF Vulcan bomber on a low flying mission
passed the same spot at the same time and on the same course

as the reported UFO.

And satellites: there are some 5000 listed objects in orbit,
satellites and space debris.. More are added each year, and
about 600 re-enter the atmosphere every year. Early this
year MOD received many reports of a large péice of debris

jéfenfbﬂvxa across the South of England: most reports

lwere factual, but one spoke of an 'oval shaped thing with a
‘white cockpit which hovered for a while than shot off at

‘ great speed'. We cannot prove it wasn't a UFO, but it

occurred at the‘same time and place as some known re-entry
of space debris.

And of course there are optical illusions. Any phenomena
thrOugh glass are particularly suspect.

There are also genuine hallucinations, sometimes on people

under stress; the excited tales of the gullible; the embellishments

of the born story teller. Also, I fear, downright lies. There

.are also hoaxes: there are some very effective aerial hoaxes which

have been perpetrated by children - which I will not describe for

/

fear of precipitating a new rash of UFO reports.
