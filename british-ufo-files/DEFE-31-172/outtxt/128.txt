5. A small difficulty haig for purely tactical reasons

unconnected with UFOs, acceded (with other countries) to a
request by the Government of Grenada for a UN study group (at
Grenadan expense) to monitor information on UFOs. The wording

of that part of the draft speech has been supplied by FCO.

6. The general line adopted is that there really are strange
phenomena in the sky, but there are perfectly rational
explanations to account for them, so there is no need to introduce

the highly questionable hypothesis of alien space craft. In other

,words, Occam's Razor.

7. The broad line was put to Lord Strabolgi. at our meeting

in December and agreed by him. Lord Strabolgi asked for further
information about cosmic distances and the difficulties of space
travel. I have not included this in the speech, because Lord
Clancarty's "sky people" are evidently "paranormal" and can cross

the light years in a trice; but some facts are included at the

'end of the background note.

8. Lord Strabolgi also mentioned the possibility of replying

on any detailed cases produced by Lord Clancarty if the latter will
give advance notice. I repeat the advice I gave in December: we
should not attempt to argue these cases, which tend to be remote

and elusive yet often cannot be refuted without very detailed
examination: indeed we should not fight the battle on Lord Clancarty's
ground at all.

9. DES have been consulted and are content.

10. You will no doubt confirm the time and place of the final

briefing, which at p: esent we have down for am Wednesday 17 January.
