5. In View of the likely Press interest in this subject I
‘am copying this minute and the draft speech to D?R(RAF) with
the request that he pass his copy to the Duty Press Officer.
I would be grateful if you would consider whether the DPO
needs any additional information; and, if so, if you would
provide it direct.
