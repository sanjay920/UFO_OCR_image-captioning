valley in which Huddersfield Town Centre is situated. Directly
across is a range of hills that make the opposite wall of the
valiey. Slightly to the right is Castle Hill. The house faces
South. There are no nearby objects.

About 8.20 pm on this day as a result of scmetnLng my mother

said I looked towards the window and saw in the sky about an angle of
30 degrees above the eye level, two bright lights Close together
like car headlights. The objects were brighter and larger than

the stars but not as large as a full moon. They were the brightest
things in the sky at the time. I could net tell if these lights

were attached to an object because the Lights were top bright.

When I first saw these objects I was indoors Looking; through the

window. The objects were at first stationary.

H

The lights appeared to be beyond the Opposite valley well.
opened the window and the lights were exactly the same when I had

first seen them.
