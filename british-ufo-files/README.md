Here we process all the pdfs in this folder.   

For this, run the ocr-pipeline.sh individually on each pdf.   
  e.g. $bash ocr-pipeline.sh DEFE-24-1924.pdf
  
After the script finishes, there will be a folder with the name same as the name of the pdf.   
The output of the pdf can be found in the <b>outtxt</b> folder. There is a text file for every page of the input pdf.
