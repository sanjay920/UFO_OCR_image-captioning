Close encounters of an alien kind

BODIES of four ‘aliens’ from it
crashed UFO (unidentified ﬂying
object) were recovered and exam-
ined by a special American
Government team 40 years ago,
according to a top-secret ‘ docu-
ment ’ obtained by a British
researcher. '

A bitter debate is now likely to
develop among UFO experts over the
existence of a mysterious committee,
code-named Maiestic~lZ, which is
supposed to have examined the
aliens.

The highly classiﬁed brieﬁng paper
claim that the then head of the CIA,
Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, repor-
ted that ' although these creatures are
human-like in appearance. the biolo-
gical and evolutionary processes
responsible for their development
have apparently been quite different
from those observed or postulated in
homo mpittu.’ .

The document, which has been
shovvn to The Ohm-rm by Timothy
Good, Britain‘s leading UFO
researcher, purports to be a brieﬁng
paper for President-elect Eisenhower
on Operation Majestic-12, also
known as MJ-lZ.

in his book, ‘Above Top Secret:
The Worldwide UFO Cover-up,‘ to
be published by Sidgwick Gr Jackson
on 9July, Mr Good claims that MJ-IZ
was a committee of senior US officials
which investigated and then covered

up news of flying saucer crashes.

Other UFO experts believe the
story could be a hoax involving the
planting of 2 fake supporting White
House memo in the ﬁles of Air Force
Intelligence and then getting the
National Archives officially to
declassify a forged document.

The Eisenhower briefing paper,
dated 18 November. I952, claims the
MJ-lZ committee had been set up by
his predecessor, President Truman.
on 24 September, 1947, as a ‘top
secret research and development]
intelligence operation responsible
directly and only to the President of
the United States.‘

The document reports that on 24
June I947, 'dbc-shaped aircraft '
were sighted in the United States.

‘ Little was learned about the
obiects until a toe] rancher reported
that one had crashed in a remote
region of New Mexico, about 75 miles
northwest of Roswell Army Air Base
(now Walker Field). .

‘ On 7 July l947, a secret operation
was begun to assure recovery of the
wreckage of this object for scientiﬁc
study. During the course of this
operation, aerial reconnaissance dis»
covered that four small human-like
beings had apparently eiectcd from
the craft at some point before it
exploded. These had fallen to earth
about two miles east of the wreckage
stte.’

According to the brieﬁng paper:
‘All four were dead and badly
decomposed due to action by preda-
tors and exposure to the elements
during the approximately one week of
time which had elapsed before their
discovery. .

' A court analytical effort resulted
in I preliminary consensus (19
September I947) that the disc was
most likely a short-range recon-
naissance craft . . .

The Majestic-12 Group remains oi
the unanimous opinion that imposi-
tion of the strictest security
precautions should continue without
interruption into the new
Administration.’
