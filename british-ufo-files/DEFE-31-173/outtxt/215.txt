Sunday 15th- July '84.

Dear Sirs,
_ On the evening of Wednesday the 11th. inst., I, together
.with my two neighbours observed an object at a very great height.
’ It shone with the magnitude of Venus at it's brightest.
We observed it through binoculars.
.th did not move for a period of about half an hour.
‘From our viewpoint it was at approximately 600 and in an estimated
N.W. direction.
It appeared to have circular form. .
I first noticed it at about 9.t5 (21.t5) and observed it until
about 21.45 at which time I went indoors to fetch my x25 telescope.
However, upon finding the 'scope I was disappointed to find that
’ the-object had disappeared.
I had however fixed it's position by aligning it with the corner
of the roof.
The time was then almost 22.00. .
.Upon making a further aligned viewing I found I was looking at
a point approximately in the centre of the "Plough" which was by
then faintly visible;

My neighbours would corroborate.
Your's Faithfully,
Seoﬂon40 ~’
