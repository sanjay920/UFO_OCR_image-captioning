5 UFO — HUDDERSFIELD.
1 At 7.15 am on Friday 15 February 1985 I was on duty in the Control

Room at Holmfirth Police Station when I received a telephone call
from SGCUOFI4O Meltham, Huddersfield

(tel: Section)40'

seCﬂ0r|40 informed me that at precisely 4.02 am the same morning
he had looked out of his house window and seen a strange object,
which he could only describe as a bright orange ball in the sky.

The location given is above Castle Hill, Almondbury, Huddersfield.
Secﬂor|40 stated that as he watched this 'object' hovering in

the sky above Castle Hill, it descended, rose up again, descended
onto moors, then rose up again, moved in the direction of the
Emley Moor mast, Emley, Huddersfield, getting gradually higher,
until it was eventually Out of sight. "

SeCﬂOFI4O called his wife, who also watched the object, he is
adamant that it was not an aircraft.

I have made enquiries with Manchester Air Traffic Control, who
confirmed that at that time a 0C9 aircraft was over this area.
