REVIEW OF AIR FORCE OPERATIONS SOPS

 

Reference:
A. D/AF Ops/2 dated 1” Jan 85

1. Thank you for Reference A in which you
asked us to examine the existing SOP No 502

(Reports of Unidentified Flying Objects).

2. Please find attached an updated version
of the SOP which takes account of reorganis-
ation. Unless copy addressees wish to add
anything I see no need for further amendment.
