THE HISTORY OF THIS MAGAZINE CONTINUED.

CNK GAINED IN popularity from 1972 to
finally closed ‘NEVER T0 APPEAR AGAIN‘. This was due to two
reasons. The first one was FINANCE. Because the magazine

was and still is INTERNATIONAL, the postage costs made

the price of CNK slightly inhibitive for those-readers who
obviously couldn't or finally wouldn't pay for them. Despite
sad letters received from regular readers, the coats and ’
the fact that the second reason was, we wanted to start up
LNO ER magazine, we decided the best thing to do was to
fold up CNK for good.

THY IS IT STILL HERE1? Wbll, only just! CNK still con—
tinued to receive exchange magazines from all over the Wbrld,
and encouraging letters too. I did not want to stop rege—
iving these, so I put out- GNK for EUROPE instead. It was
the oheper way. By not being involved with English copies
the coats went down, and CNK continued. Naturally people
in Europe do not all speak Englishl Therefore it was also
a good excuse for me to learn several European Languages.

I was now committed. I had to produce CNK in German,
Swedish, Italian, Danish, a tiny bit of French, and then
nearly too— Russian. This took up many many man hours
with various foriegn dictionaries in my hand, trandlating
both ways. Sometimes hilarious, sometime fine. But CNK
continued.

There always now has to be an 'excuse‘ for me to ‘bring
out another issue‘. So because the climate was right...
out came two more issues. TEE STANSTEAD SPACE SHUTTLE
ISSUE 28 and the SUFFOLK UFO LANDING_CASE issue 27;

The excuse for THIS issue is that I have a backlog
of UFO and other data to get out, and ultimately dispose
of, being within these pages now. ~BUT I MUST ADMIT
that is closing down CNK I have lost all my circulation.

Those who I sent copies to last time in good faith,
still have not sent in their payment. Thatwas 1984:

Come now Lads and Lassies, if this magazine is to
make anything of a comeback its up to you to support
it. I don't MIND giving GNK away in an exchange or
as a first SAMPLE copy, but we can't do it for all
and sunlry. NUMBERS MQEQQE

out cannot be recalled and altered, therefore I have taken

because of this also, some of your letters, some oontainin
scriptions, or single payments have only just been disoove
in the last few weeks. W6 are terribly sorry about this. A
they are about three years old, hopefully ihe reader will
be at his address when he or she receives this issue...out
the blue, now!

WHO KNOWS what the future may bring. It is very nice to vi
what could happen to CNK in the next 5 years. Maybe we wi
another method of production which will make it QUICKER ax
to produce, as well as cheaper. Maybe we will get back on:
CIRCULATION of 1975-80, and that will get us back agamn or
