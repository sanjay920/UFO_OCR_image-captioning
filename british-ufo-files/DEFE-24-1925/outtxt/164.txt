notwithstanding the enigmatic nature

Slo’wly bnt Surely, I came round
to the 'Conclusion that then was

perhapsthere were metaphysical and

even spiritual associations involved
in it all,

In common with most interested

researchers, I pursued the convent-
ional round of enquiry-reading of
selective books and journals,attending

mcctinns and lectures, pattieipating
indiscussions and dialogues, taking
part in skywatcbcs. engaging inpress
and private correspondence with in-
tcrested members of the public,

studying reports and sightings, ect.
(I still engage in this basic ground
work of tesarch ). ‘

‘It was later I came to rbad the
5.001: uros - OPERATION TROJAN
HORSE by John A. Keel the Anaemia
ioumatist and ufobgist who made what is
d‘hncd to be‘m exhaustive study of un'
identified ﬂying objeets'. ‘

consideration. I woutd game the followio
n: wmment: “A major but little explored
aspect of the UFO phenOmenon is there-
fore theological and philosophies}. tathet
then pmely scientiﬁc. The UFO problem
can never be untangied by physicists and
scientists, unless they axe men who hate
been schooleJ in the libetal um, theology
and philosophy. Unfortunately, most
scientiﬁc disiples are so demanding that
their practitioners have little time or ep-
titude to study complicattd wbjccls out-
side their om: immediate ﬁelds ofinteteet.)

A further statement by Mr.
Keel relating to the same line of
thought, is also worthy of note:
“History psychiatry and
the occult have proved to be far more
impommt than the many books
which simply recount the endless
sightings of aerial anomalies..."

I am inclined to agree with him in
this observation. In my follow - up
.worlt. I try to go into the matter
In grantee depth and ascertain what
the reel significance is and how it In“
ects mankind today, individually and
collectively. This aspect could
lead us into the very heart of the
whole phenomenon! But pleas: to-
member, this cans to: a trniy ‘opell

.a very. high ordet, what I all
