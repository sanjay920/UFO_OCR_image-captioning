The DIA eValuation officer
refers to this incident as
an "outstanding report,”
because the objects were
seen by many witnesses of
high credibility; the vis—
ual sightings had radar

reported by three separate
aircraft and physiological
effects were reported by
some 0: the crew members.
Furthermore, the UFOs dis—
played an "inorinate amOunt

Comparing the UFO problem
to a rattlesnake on a forest
path, the NSA report says,
”you would‘havutto treat.thhe
alarm as if it were a real
andimmediate threat to your
survival. Investigation would-
become an intensive emergency
action to isokmethe threat
and to determine its precise
nature. It would be geared

to developing adequate defense

goes On to say that the now

BLUE BOOK UFO STUDY hever had
a chance to receive the ‘out-

An Air Force document states:
"Reports of UFOs which could
affect national security are
made in accordance with JANAP
146 or Air Force Manual 55—11
and are not part of the Blue
Book system.” The Air Force‘s
investigations were criticised
as long ago as 1952 by the CIA.
They complained that the U.S.
Air Force's caseLby—oase in-
vestigations and explanations,
were insufficient to determine
the exact nature of the phenom—
