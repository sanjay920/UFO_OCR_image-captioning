Dear Sir/Madam,

According to my MP,the Rt Ron Mariya Reesgyour department will be able to help me in my
research for reports of alleged unidentified Fl ing Objects (UFOs) from the era of the
Second World War.

I would therefere like to request any information you have on the reported sightings of
UFOs during the Second World War.The term UFO was probably not used bat we have reasen to
believe that the term °FOO FIGHTER’ or simply reporis of 'UNGONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT" were
useé by both allied and German aircrews alikea

I would also like ta r9quest any informaqion you might have on UFO reports in general:
either before,during or after the war.

If your department does not have such information an file ﬁe you knaw of any establishment
thai might,if you do I would appreciate it if you ccald supply me with the address of tuis
establishmeﬂt.

3 look forward to yeur reply,untill then I am,

Yours Sincerel
