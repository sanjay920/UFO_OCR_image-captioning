Dear Sir.

For your infcrmation I work in Knightsbridge.

My office colleagues and I saw a shining object

above your Barracks on Friday the alst December at about
2.00 pm which stayed up for a while and then. all of a
sudden, disappreared from our view.

Did a! one of your people see this shining object above
your $ rracks on that day and. if so, what was it? I look
forwÔ¨Årq to hearing from you.
