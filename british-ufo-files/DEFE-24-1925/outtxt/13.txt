POSSIBLE UFO - HEATHROW AIRPORT AREA
Thank you for your letter of 7 May 1986, addressed to Air Traffic Control.

I regret to say I am not able to help you. I have looked in the ATC log for
2 April 1986 but nothing untoward was reported, around noon or during that

day.
I have therefore forwarded your letter and contents to the Ministry of Defence
(APO) Division 8 in London. That Department deals with reports on UFOs and if

you have any further information please send it to them at Main Building,
Whitehall SW1A 2H8.

Yours sincerely

40
