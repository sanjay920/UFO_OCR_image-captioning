Dear Flight Lieutenant-

Thank you for your letter to PUFOIC;of 25 May I985.
As you will notice,l haVe since moved to Cheshire earlier this month,
from my previous residence in P1ymouth,Devon. I hope that you will
notate my new address.

Althnugh I have moved some 270milea Nbrth:,I am still in
charge of the investigation int. the,aa yet,Unidentified Flying Object
wnich was observed very close to ybur Air Fbrce Baae,during early
February this year.

I fully appreciate your attention to my correspondance,
although as yet,I have not had any correspondance from the Ministry
of Defence. I presume that this was to their department in London.
If they have replied tn my previous Plymouth address,I have left
firm instructions to forward any mail on to me here in Winsford.

Since my laﬁtu letter to you,we have discovered other local
people in the St Mawgan vicinity who probably observed thia same
phennmenon as the original witness,and naturally they are a little
concerned frtm a safety angle.

I would he most grateful if the Ministry of Defence would
either provide an explanation for this incident,or admit that there
are,” yet,no explanations as to what several people observed.
Unfortunately,the longer their reply takea,UFD Assaciationa,and the
general public grew in suspicion that a more sinister aspect was
the explanation. I ' could accelerate their reply to us"
