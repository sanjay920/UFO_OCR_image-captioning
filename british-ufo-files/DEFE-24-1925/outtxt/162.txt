ITORIAL .
It has been 22 years now since that
famous UFO sighting by Ken Arnold,
and we are no closer to them today“

All we have the power to do is stand

and stare in awed rapture at rain
sodden skies on skywatches, hoping
something spectacular will happen,
snap photographs, investigate other
people's claims, spend public money
on projects like the Condon Report
which has apparently been controver-
sial to some, and print volumns of
literature, and read read read about
item for another 22 or more years.
