Dear Sir,
F5 EDA CTED Oral Ci RE I GINAL
With regards to the above named subject and source. It has come to our attention
that on the 19th June 1980 a Miss observed a large spherical shaped object
heading out to sea at a slow Speed. The object was seen for several minutes to
display a pulsating red glow. The witness states the time was approximately 14.00.
”HJCTED ON ORIGINAL
ﬁiss failed to identify the subject image and therefore contacted the local
police at Scarborough. At approximately 3.30pm, some 90 minutes after observing
the phenomena, the witness was contacted by personnel at Fylingdales. They asked
numerous questions in relation to the purported sighting.

«wglﬁe would be grateful for a copy of the report held by your base. Ministry of Defence
.policy is not to release 'UFO' reports due in the main for witness confidentiality
purposes. However the witness requires no such assurance and therefore the non-
release of this report would perhaps indicate one potential. RAF Fylingdales has
the capability to track just about anything anywhere and one must pressume the
advanced system used by your base réoeived a return from this target?

k-Je would be pleased to forward a detailed copy of —reporﬁ,any informat-
ion received will be used for research purposes only. Thank you for your time and

we look forward to receiving your reply.

  
 
  

Sincerel
