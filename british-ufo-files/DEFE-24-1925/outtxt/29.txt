to discuss Saudi proposals for
British investment to othm
the £5 billion Tornado ﬁghter

The in vestmcnt programme

The difference is that the

US offset programme as

were signed with private com-
panies. No such riot agree-
ment was rcachc before the
Tomado deal was signed.

Mr Younger IS expected to
meet King Fahd and other

may lead to another arms deal
