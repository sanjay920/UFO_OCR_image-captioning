 

CONCLUSION AND
OUR POLICY ON UFOs

Cosmology Newslink's policy on
unidentiﬁed flying objects is based
on the statements and article seen
on pages 4 & 5, also on our own
inv-st§gttions into them. Our policy
is now as follows:-

‘We would like ice '

believe that UFOs
exiSt; so we hope to

find evidence. in some

form other than photographic
and present an overall picture

on them in general.
We hope not to give up
the long walk do wn an eadkss road

in sheer frustration, but continue to
seek for answers until we can reach
the satisfactory conclusion that the
whole wotld has for centuries been
waiting for.

It was Stationary and remained

It began to move and took‘

behind it.
slowly it increased in brilliance
to eight magnitude and then
suddenly died out. As soon
as this had happened a most
extraordinary noise took to
the air. This noise can best
be described as a cracklig
sound of a very high volumn.
