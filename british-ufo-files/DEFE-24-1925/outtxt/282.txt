Thank you for your lette s of 2% February and 23 Warch 1985;
I am sorry that I ha ave been unable to reply before now. I regret
that the Department could not juzstify the expenditure in terms of
time and effort whic h would be required to collate infOImation on
re101ts of UFO‘s 1n the Dyfed area since 197.. '

You may find it useful if f explain that the sole interest of
the United Kingdom V1nistry of De fence in re ported sightings of
Unid entified Flying Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have
any bear1ng on the defence of the country.

There is no org anis atloh 1n the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose or studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as wart of their morn l duties.

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to p 55 ble de fence
1 mplications we have not carried out a study into t? cien ntific
gnifie ance of these phenomena. Unless there are 0 nee
implications we do not attempt to identizy sightings and we cannot
inform observers of the prob able identity of the object sern. 1he
De; artmeht could not justi fy the expenditure of public fun- 3

investigations wn1ch go beyond the pure defence interests.

{ie have to recogn :58 that there are many strange things to be
een in the sky, but we believe there are adequate explalati ens for
hem. The y may be sate .1ite debris rewehtering the earth atmosphere,
all lightning, uansua 1 cloud format101s, meteorologioal balloons,
ircraft lights, aircraft at unu“ua1 angles or many ot.er things.
here is certainly no evidence that ”alien spacecraft" have landed on
he p1anet. Although we have not ca“r3 .ed out our own studies, we are

“ware of independent studies 1nto the UFOs notably by the University
of Colorado publis shed in 19é9. T‘his concluded that 90% of all UFOs
repor ted could be p3ausibly re1ated to ordinary phenomeha‘
