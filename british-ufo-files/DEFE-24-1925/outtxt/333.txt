1: RAF weedbridge 27 December 1980: I realise we hwve discussed this matter at
length, but a great deal of vital new information has come our way since concluditg
our book "SKX CRASH“ last year. I would like to pose seme Specific questions to you:—

{a} What is your position regarding the involvement of the BritiSh Civiliaﬂ 901109
in the taking of photOgrephs of the landed object? We have e1:celleht evidence tor
this, and preSIme th"t the British police would advise the MoD.If not, then why not?

(b) :ou have doubtles s seen the extensive "Smear" campaign being successfully waged

- the British media (under whose guidance i wonder ?).Eg. "The Guardian",5 Jan 1985.
Oh this thesis a gross mistake was made (a 1 iehthouse seriouz3ky misperoeived, backgrour
radiation levels viewed as sinister,rabhit holes regarded as SOthhing else}. Not onlg
thst,but this "evidence" was supported by the US deputy base commander and the UK
base commander,whom 17 days later cOuld surely have figured some of these Cockuups ou1
This grand blunder is then perpetuated over the course of years;the UK commander
ramains in charge, the two base commanders (USI,a¢ the time and subsequenthDendorse

base commander. how regardless of what sort of MOD investigation into these events
was (or was not) conducted this leaves one with a serious dilemma.IF the ”J_ighthous e/
normal radiatioh/rabbits" theory is correct then e1 your strategic commanders at a
NATO base (for which you certainly have jurisdictioh) are incompetent dodos who might
be eXpeoted to misinterpret Orford Hess lighthouse for an invading MIG jet,not have

I think the people of this country might be rather worried if that were the case. And

fr Mllgv, unle SS you can help us refute this lighthmus e nonsense then we are just
gaing to have to make sure the Brutish people see this intere sting pare Wox.Believe me

we have people in the right place to make sure this hsppens. Comments please.
