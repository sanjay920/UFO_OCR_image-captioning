A. D/US of S(AF)DGI 28/1/u dated 1 Aug 85

1. You asked at Reference A for briefing for Lord Trefgarne’s
meeting with Lord Hill—Norton 0h 2 October. I attach a piece
covering the questions posed by Lord Hill-Norton in his letter of 26
July. I believe this adequately covers the broader issues and I see
no need for further background briefing. However I attach a specific
piece on the "RAF Woodbridge/Bentwaters" incident in which Lord Hill-
Norton has previously shown an interest.

2. I would suggest that Minister is supported at the meeting by
Hd of Seo(AS) and representatives of D Air Def and DSTI. I would
also like to attend myself if you have no objection. I understand
that Minister will wish to run through the brief prior to the meeting
itself and that we should therefore meet at 14.30 on Wednesday 2 Oct.
I should be grateful if you would let us know the venue in due
course.
