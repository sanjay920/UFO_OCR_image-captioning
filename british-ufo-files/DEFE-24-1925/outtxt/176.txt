CNK's rough dram
wing of a UFO
in fact 2 hub—caps
'7. joined together.

a't know now what type of cars were on the road in 1964,
as you can see from the rough sketch above,right, I

ed two car hub caps together, which I have had for years,
about 1967 and they matched the photo almost entirely

he Warminster 'thing’ in 1964. Now I‘m wondering what car

3964, the hub cabs came from to fake the ?hoto: ebove.

Fittedly, something odd DID occur in Warminster 1n the

3‘s. Your editor went there with a stereoscopic camera

it 1967 to investigate things like, dead pidgeons,UFO‘s
Arthur Shuttlewood, who doesn't think much of this

,zine.

CNK is TOO probing, that‘s why?

Although the

.gs on in ﬁarminster are definitely REAL, and strange
;cts have been sightedo I don't think, howeverg that

This could well be a
guenine UFO photo.

I have seen one very
similar in 1981.

It was in the hand—
bag of my tutor’

at a certain col—
lege in Chelms-
ford, Essex.She
would NOT allow me

identify her. This
seems to be a 'com-
mon' UFO formation.

On showing these UFO photos to someone

who did not know they were UFO photos,

the following definitions were gi 1-

that in their opinion they were:

1. Video camera streak.

. Two plates of different sizes. ; ;

from above. L

However, that there are guenuine UFOs

there seems to be no doubt. Finding the

fakes out from the truth is very diffi—

cult. It would be a good idea if photos

of objects were put through computer

enhancement more often, and the people

f raomo FILE ON THE UFO RESEARCHERS AND HUNTERS:

Throughout the 60's and 1970's and maybe even today, UFO's have
fasinated ordinary foﬂa. Some have actually had encounters with

‘ them. In the few following pages, we reproduce some unpublished

photos of those who have spent many hours on this unrewarding
research:
