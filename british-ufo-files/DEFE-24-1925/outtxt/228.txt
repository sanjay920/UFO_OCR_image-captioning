Thank you for our letter of 11 May which enclosed a further
letter from

 

”; I am afraid I have little to add to what I said in my letter of
20 February 1985 in reply to your or1)1na1 enquiry on this matter.
We remain satisfied that the events reported by Co1cnel Halt on
13 January 1981 are of no defence significance. The report was,
like all other UFO reports, examined at the time by those in the
Depa"tment r sponsible for the air dc fe nee 0f the UK and we haV€
since seen nothing to alter our views.

Turning toqrequest for copies of‘ all 1110 reports we
have received since 19 O, I am afraid ‘hat t1e Dppav1m1ut could

not Justii‘ the effort 1nv01v'e d in accedir.g to this request.
HQWever, W111 a1ready know that we are prepared to

re1ea3e réﬁbﬁfé of specific inciéents to.1nteresteﬂ parties and,

e0p1es of 1he,e fram Sec1AS)2 in my Der war ment, wuose address is
