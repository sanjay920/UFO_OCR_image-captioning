simply did not feel it was the right thing to do, as. he was anxious to avoid
causing offence. As to his ‘rejection', which he found mildly disappointing , he
attributes this to his bronchial and arterial problems, and thinks that the amber
scanning device (if that is what it was) detected the plastic replacement

following an operation for arteriosclerosis.

_ suffered none of the harmful side~effects sometimes reported by
close encounter witnesses, such as temporary paralysis, nausea, diarrhea, skin and
eye irritation, headaches, and so on; nor is he aware of any amnesia or time lapse.
But he told me that he did feel "different” after the experience. He ate little
for a while, resulting in some loss of weight, and felt less inclined to go out.

He found difficulty getting to sleep, due to continually turning the events over in
his mind. But he has few regrets about his extraordinary experience, which in my
opinion ranks as one of the most convincing Close encounter cases I have invest—
igated.

”Until I had this encounter with the UFO,“ he told me, ”I always took the
talk about them with a pinch of salt, but now I know they are a fact. During the
time I was with them I felt no fear, only curiosity, nor were they hostile towards
me nor I to them. My only regret about the whole affair is that I did not have
another person along with me to see and experience something that I did not believe
in until it happened to me, and I think myself lucky that I am here today to speak
about it, for I am sure that these men were out to abduct some person, and that
person could have been me. But at the same time I will say that it was the greatest

experience of my life."
