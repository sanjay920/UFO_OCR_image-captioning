UFO ENQUIRY —

Please find attached a self explanatory letter
from -who corresponds with this office
regularly. I also attach a copy of the report
to which he refers. I would be grateful for
your advice on whether any follow—up enquiries
were made at the time the report was received
and, if so, what conclusions were reached. Any
comments you may have on the question of
release of the report would also be
appreciated.
