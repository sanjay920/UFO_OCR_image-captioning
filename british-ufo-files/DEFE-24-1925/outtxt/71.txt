the guard but of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers workshops must have

heard or seen something, but checks by investigator_drew a blank. He

was also unable to trace the two mounted policemen. And the occupants of a bungalow
near the canal lock beside Gasworks Bridge were away at the time.

the railway bridge (Aldershot to Waterloo main line) which is about 100 yards to
the south of the landing site, but there were none; at least, not while he was out—
side the craft. But even if a train had gone by it is doubtful if anyone would
have noticed the object except at those times when it was at its most brilliant,
i.e. during landing and take—off. No cars were seen on either Government Road or
Camp Farm Road, which runs beside the Basingstoek Canal at the spot where

was fishing, nor have any witnesses come forward.

largest-selling tabloid, the National Enquirer, who ran a story on the case the

following year. (14)
