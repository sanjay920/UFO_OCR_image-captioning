F2: INVASION ore HOAX?[:::J

sarily an alien controlled space vehicle -
then it could be that these marks were
caused by some sort of landing gear
which would not be lowered until the
vehicle was actually going to land.

Certainty from an examination of some
of the sites: Patching. Sussex, 28/29 June;
Bratton. 28/29 June; Hampshire. 6/7 July;
Andover in Wiltshire. July 1985: there
seems no doubt that the circles were
produced by an object coming out of the
sky. At this stage there is. apart from the
UFO sightings. no evidence from which
we can identify a known vehicle as being
responsible.

Flattened easily

On one occasion it was suggested that
the crop could have been flattened easily
by two people using a piece of string. One
person would stand in what would
eventually be the centre of the circle,
whilst the other person would walk
around in ever decreasing circles flatten-

ing the crop as he did so. However, whilst
the crop would most certainly be flat—
tened, it would not be done as neatly.
There woutd also be some evidence of
their walk from the edge of the field to the
markings. Even walking along the plough
tracks woukd not, as it has been sug-
gested, mean that the circles could be
made without some damage to surrouno
ding crops.

No doubt speculation regarding this
phenomena will continue. but perhaps,
should it occur again. more information
will come to tight and enable us to get
nearer to providing an explanation for
this mystery.
