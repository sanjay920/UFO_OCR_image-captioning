Roy Lake discusses a UFO sighting with some of his friends in
Dagenham. In May 1974 Roy had a full page item in the ADVERTISER
entitled: ARE THESE INVADERS FROM AN UNKNOWN PLANET. By M.Gill°
The aticle showed the legendary Adamski UFO photos and also the
Essex UFO Study Group at work . Other members were then, Peter,
Brailsford,Roy Lake, David Prockter, and Ron Markwick, who is
still about, but I'm not sure if his interest in UFO‘s is as
strong¥now, after a recent illness.
