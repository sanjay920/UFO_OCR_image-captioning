Dear Mr Noyes

addressed to

Thank ou for your lett er of 25 Februa ry 1935,
3 left this division

who, as I believe you now know, M1

 

o . I am sorry that I have not been able to reply before
w. Thank you also for sight of the extracts from your Hropos d
o

In his letter of 20 March 198M, — explained the
MOD’S position rewarding Colonel Halt's reports on events near RAF
‘doodbridg e in 1980, and I ha ve little to add to the views
expressed. I know from your letter that you are well aware of the
limited extent of the MOD's interest in the subject. Monetheless,
there are, perhaps, one or two points which I should (make. Firstly,
whilst I cannot, of course, comment on the proportion of UFO
sightings which are not reported, I can assure you that those which
are reported to local police forces and to the Civil Aviation
authority should all be passed on to this division of the MOD. We
treat all these reports seriously in case they show anything of
defence int erest However, we have never found any reason to believe
that, in the de fence context, such reports warrant more detailed
research. Equally, since our ihte rest extends only as far as defence
of the UK, there has never been any formal liaison with other
Governments.

Turning to your specific questions ab mt txe 2k odbridge
iﬁent, I oen~assure you that no unidentified o 039 at was seen on
radax recordings during the period in question, and that the MOD
Ids no knowledge of the tape—recording or cine film you mention. As
we have said in the past, the report sent by Colonel Halt was
examined by those in the Department responsible for tie air defence
of the UKe and since then there has been nothing to alter the view
that ther was no defence significance to the incident.
