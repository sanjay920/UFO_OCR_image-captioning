I "m encuireing aeout the artical in the Eews Of The World news»

Y3

paper about ihe H.?.O landings in Suffolk mnglandc The artical was in the

nd
paper on October 2

1983. I phoned the Hews of The World, but they couldn‘t
tell me much more than what was in the paper, so I phoned the U.S.A.F base
in Suffolk where the U.F.O was eurppoee to have landed, they couldn’t tell
me much because most of the people who were there at the time of the landing
had left and went back dome. One of the personal said that an offical report
had gone to 'he ﬁ.OoD

The M.C.D don’t investigate H.?.Os any more, so they said, why if that
incident was investagated hasn't the public heard any more about an incident
that took place in 1980? So why did it take the ﬁs0.ﬂ three years to say any~
thing about it? And why did three or four of the Briiish dirmen after they
had supposedly seen and touched the object, whee they semi back to the camp
and were tested by the N.C.O with a geiger coﬁnter and placed in isolation
until the all clear was given? Why were t ey also told to sign the Offical
~ecrets Act, and why did some of the.American Airmen, who were there, had their
A» 6 rifes taken from them before the object landed? Why , out of all the
places that the object could have landed9 it lanﬁed next to a British and
American Air base?

Tne ob4ect was alsc )ioked u b the near b1 civilian Airwerﬁ radar but

a later report said that tﬂe objeci was ir act a seam 120m a lighthouse, but
radar éosn‘u wick up beams of lighi. Who ever aave that ate: to the news

paper reporter I'm sure he could have made u; a better story than that°

E wou1& be very gxeteful if you could tele me the truth behind the artical.

The only reason why I bring up the matter after so long is because a friend

only just showed me the said articel.

Yours Sincerely.
