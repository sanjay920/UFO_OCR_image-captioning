The light at this time was going furthe lack in the sky cn‘ throughout
the whole time the object was moving very fﬁ at and very err ratic the
whole time. I am not a nutter. I 'pnor ed the police who sent three
officers round, who all witnessed and agreed this was not a plane or a
star and that it was flashing colours and moving very erratic. This
object was also viewed through binoculars by the police and myself”.
