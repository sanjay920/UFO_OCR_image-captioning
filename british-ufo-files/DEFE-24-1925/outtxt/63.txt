during the 1960s,he undertook an investigatien into reported sightings of Unidentified
Flying ijects,better known simply as UFOs.

quote“153 reports have been received in the ministry of defence in the last 6 months.Seme
of these are still being investigated"unquote.

Also in parliamentary writen answera 0f the 8th of November 1967 Mr Rees gaes on to say,
quote "I have published details of all the investigations which have been made over the
gears” unquote.ln the same writen question$ of the same date Mr Rees statesquote "He have
access to scientists of high ggpute~they have been consulted on all these ﬂatters"unquota.

Mr Rees himself has staﬁed that you can supply me with all the published results of the
investigations into UFOs and that you will alse be able to supply me wiﬁh all the details
as to who was involved in such investigations and haw they were carried out.
