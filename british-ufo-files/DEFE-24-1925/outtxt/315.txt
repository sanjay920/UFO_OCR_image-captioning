I attach a letter which the Secretary of
State has received from a member of the public,
and which has been acknowledged by this office.

Z.’ I should be grateful if you would arrange
for the appropriate action to be taken, includir
a reply as necessary. Since the Secretary of
State attaches importance to such letters
addressed to him being answered promptly, any
reply should be sent within two weeks of the dat
of this minute. If, exceptionally, this should

prove impossible an interim reply should be sent
within the same timescale.
