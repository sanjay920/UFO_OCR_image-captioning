Your letter to RAF Boulmer of 16 March 1985 has been passed to
me in view of your interest in Unidentified Flying Objects. You may
find it useful if I explain that the sole interest of the United
Kingdom Ministry of Defence in reported sightings of Unidentified
Flying Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have any bearing
on the defence of the country.

There is no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed
solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no
staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties.

Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence
implications we have not carried out a study into the scientific
significance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence
implications we.do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot
inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The
Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on
investigations which go beyond the pure defence interests. I am
afraid we could not therefore undertake to provide you with
information on sightings in the Boulmer area. Nevertheless, we are
prepared to release reports of specific incidents on request and if
there are any recent cases in which you have a particular interest, I
would be happy to see if we have any information.

I attach copies of two recent Parliamentary Questions on the

Ministry of Defenoe's interest in UFO reports, which you may be
interested in.
