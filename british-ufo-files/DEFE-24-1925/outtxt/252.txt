the Centre began. In tlat ”a?_rce 2A.. ULK. UFO publications have gone onto
this system. Th1s period has Riven me a un1qL ue ins lght into this material
which covers the years 1965t08A1 Whil. t it must be unde1stood that the
type of references one adopts Ois govezned by what is indexed, the

A byief look at some su jnct-headimgs and references show that some
