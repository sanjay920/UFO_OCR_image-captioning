Most BRIGHT objec-ts arerseen at night. This could
almost anything; We have seen them ourselves and a
at best they are meteors breaking up, and glowing
as they enter the atmosphere. I have not yet ,
seen ONE BRIGHT UFO in the DAYTIME. Have you?

So far, they say, the Defence Ministry have failed to e
an amazing sequence of si ghtihgs, some by RAF officers.

Mrs Pauline Coombs claims she was chased by a UFO as sh

her children home to Ripplestone Farm. As she reached it
wiring burnt out. That was in.January 1977.Before the ye
out she and her husband Billy reported seeing UFO's at 0
quarters many times.
CNK COMMENT: I think it is odd that after UFO's have be
and reported in a certain area, they then are never seen
in that area for a long time. Isn't that strange! It sma
a secret government invention being tested out, which wb
DISCOVERED is quickly withdrawn when it is reported fron
'seoret' testing area, or in the night: or a a time when
us should be in bed. In other words, a man made machine
has not q te ready for use, or will NEVER be revealed 6
its very nature. THINK ABOUT IT! Radar was secret at or

glowing silver clothes and helmets.

they saw. Their drawings matched. So did their reports.
headmaster hiohard Llwhelin said: "Children of that age
capable of maintaining such an elaborate hoaxr"

Gﬂi: As if in answer to my above comments we see;—

ments, £0 QHIGHLY SECRET. (capitals ours). -The RAF con
a flood of Lh‘reports and said the sightings did not match
operations. (well it wouldn't_ if it was secret—would it

But on June 15, 1977, the then Ealiametary Uhdereseore
for Defence, Mr. James wellbeloved told loeel Tory M. P.

apart from Mrs Grenville, one report by the Ministry ha
