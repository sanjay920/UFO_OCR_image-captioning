REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ABOUT AIRCRAFT MOVEMENTS

I have received your letter of 2 October in which you pose a variety of
questions about aircraft movements in North Yorkshire. Unfortunately we
do not have the information you require. Bowever, I have invited our
air traffic people to treat your information and queries in the same
manner as any from the public concerning low flying aircraft.

Having done this, I cannot promise any outcome. I also suggest that since
We are but a small unit with a very limited compliment of aircraft you may
wish to consider alternative avenues of enquiry.
