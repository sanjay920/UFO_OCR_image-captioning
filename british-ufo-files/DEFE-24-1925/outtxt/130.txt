FILMS FOR PROCESSING FOR SEC (AS) 2 RAF

 

Reference
A. My D/DAAC/ZB/GA dated 6 Aug 85

1. Ref A accompanied negatives of an unusual sighting near Middle Wallop and
asked that prints and negatives be forwarded to—.PRINCIPLE SEC
(AS) 2-RAF and that copies be sent to Middle Wallop for the cival photographer
whose film it was.

2. During my absence on leave a packet of photographs was received here and
was passed on to the photographer, however, it would appear that SEC (AS) 2
have not seen them. Could you confirm whether or not prints and negatives were
forwarded to them. A telephone call would suffice. '
