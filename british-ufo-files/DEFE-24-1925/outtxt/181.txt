COMET.AIIEDIA STAR. '

Halley‘s Comet alreadyeis shaping a; es_a major media evsigl
of 1986; that is when the celestial traveller will be visi—
ble for about four nights. At least two enterpreneurs are
phnning to feature the comet on television specials for
syndication,although they do not want their names disclosed
yet. The TV networks and print media are expected to devote
considerable time to the comet. This will mark the first
time that TV coverage will be possihb. Looking at all the
multi—media ooverageas indirect public relations for its
project, one of the syndicators has developed a logo for its
program and has begun lining up licensees in the United
States and abroad. (F&om Advertising Age,00pyright 1984,

an interesting letter sent to CNK from Martin Dawson

_0f the York Astronomical Society in 1982 concerning comets:—

"Please find enclosed cuttings, especially the one about a
possible collision with a comet. Bit frightening eh? It may
turn out to be like Kohoutek and the alignment of the pleb—
ets where nothing happened, but who knows. When are you
going to bring back CNK on to the market? I miss that old
mag and still look at old copies.

I will have to go now, tarraa, yours, Martin Dawson. YAS.
*CNK lodked at the cutting at it Was about comet Swift—

‘Tuttle, and a warning that it might collide with the earth.

Yet again it missed us by a million miles. The warning

was put out by Dr. Brian Marsden, of the Smithsonian Astro—
nomical Observatory in Massachussets. He calculated the oddd
at l in 2 million of a collisiOn. They are greater odds
than the annual chances of a disastertfrom random astronomi-
cal events, such as a collision with an asteroid or a nearby
stellar explosion. If Swift Tuttle had hit land the effect

would be far greater than theﬂlargest nuclear weapon. It

NOSTAGLIC NOTE:

'would burrow a crater about 12 miles wide and wreak total des—
'tru

"n over a radius of 200 miles. But if it fell into the

cos it would be'even worse. It would rains a cloud of steam

'that would cover half‘the wo£1&, blocking off the sunlight;

Already once this century, in 1908 the earth has been
struck by a comet. But it occurred in a remote region of Sib»
eria. Frightful devastation was caused, but there were no in-
juries. Some researchers think this comet radiated radiation

fand traces were found 100 years later. Some even think it was
a crashed UFO, since witnesses, some alive today, are sure that
.it was under guidance on the way down. No proof has yet been

found. Swift—Tuttle comet however was first seen in 1862,
named by its disooverers, goes far out into deep space, and re—
turns to the vicinity of the earth every 120 years. 'So like

'Balley‘s comet, if you miss it, you may never get abother chan—

of Cosmology Newslink, that new way of printing is really good,
it looks like the print in FER. The idea_of sections is pretty
good and seems to be working out fine. Y0u will find enclosed
a 60p subscription plus some more MIB articles. It was a good
idea to dedicate the first issue to Rita, it gires a good

very month 25 years ago ISTRA was founded. The exact date was

the 4 October 1957, when Sputnik l was launched and Edward Har-
