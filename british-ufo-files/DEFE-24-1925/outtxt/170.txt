The CIA denied any cover—up when approached by gun repcrt
are. A spokesman said the Agency stopped monitoring UFO's
in 1953. But our investigations reveal that CIA agents
were still probing UFO'S as late as 1975--ahd telling
people they interviewed not to disclose their interest.

And in his books Vbn Buttlar says that the CIA have been

taking UFO‘s very seriously, even while maintantig a flood
of public denial. . .

In 1957 a CIA official admitted: ”One thing is for sure,
were being observed by beings from outer space.”

And two inquiries in 1959 and 1969 both reported that a
third of all UFO sightings could not be explained away.

If the authorities take UFO's so seriously whygdon‘t

they admit it?

Acording to Von Buttlar,

From 1945 onwards, Vbn Buttlar says, both America and
Russia were convinced that UFO'S were spectacular advanced
technology their yivals had captured from the Nazis. .

Man‘s new advance into space brought new sightings.

Astronauts James Mcdivitt and Ed White saw a silver ot

Top NASA experts in Houston dismissed it as their boos
rocket in orbit alongside them.

But MaDevitt said: "It was in the wrong place at the w
time for that. ” '

Other US astronauts have reported brightly shining cap
on their journeys. But NASA consistently denies that the
spacecraft.

Astronaut Gordon Cooper says; "The American Space Agen
and Government know very well that intelligent beings fr
other worlds regularly visit our planet to enter into di
contact and observe us. They have an enormmus amount oft
but have kept quiet in order not to alarm peoPIe.”

Von Buttlar says that when Jimmy Carter was campaiging:
presidency, he promised to Jreveal all" about UFO's. He
done so. ‘

British UFO experts agree with Von Buttlar that there h.
