Further to my letter of 24 July, I am now writing to enquire if there Is any
possibility of the Ministry releasing to me a sketch of an unidentified object

which was made by PC —at Stanmore, Middlesex, on the night of

26 April I984.

I understand from Scotland Yard Press Bureau that a full report of the incident
(which involved at least haIf a dozen police officers and four witnesses) was
sent to the MOD and Civil Aviation Authority. , the Police Area
Press Officer (Harrow) told me that the sketch would not be released, and that
this was more properly a matter for the MOD.

 

 

 

In view of the Ministry's oft—repeated statement that no defence significance
has been found to date, I am puzzled why a drawing of a flying saucer should
remain classified, especially since the officer Concerned has given a detailed
description to the newspapers.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely
