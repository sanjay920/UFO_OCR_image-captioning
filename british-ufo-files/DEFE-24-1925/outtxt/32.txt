"7 April 1986

 

Further to my letter to you of 5 March I am afraid that we are
unable to shed any light on the photographs which you sent to us for
inspection.

You will know of course that the sole interest of the Ministry
of Defence in reported sightings is to establish whether they have
any bearing on the defence of the country. The reports we receive
are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for
the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports
as part of their normal duties. If it is decided that they have no
bearing on the defence of the UK then no further action is taken.

As to the other sightings you mentioned in your letter I am
afraid that we did not receive any formal reports on the dates in
question in the Leicestershire area.

I am sorry I cannot be of further help to you.

Yours sincerely
