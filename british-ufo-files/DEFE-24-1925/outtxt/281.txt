Dear Sirs

I would be extremely grateful if you could answer the following questions
regarding the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, in which we share a
common interest:—

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

Is AS—Z now the sole recipient within the MoD for collating UFO
reports from members of the public?

Which department within the MOD now handles reports from the
military?

Is there a department within the MOD where all reports (i.e. from
the public, police, military, civilian pilots etc.) are collated
and analysed?

How many reports from the defence services of the United Kingdom
have been received by the MOD between 1959—1984? I realize that
this is a tall order, but wish to point out that for the period
June I957—June 1958 a figure of 54 reports (from military sources)
was confirmed in the House of Commons by Mr Charles Orr—Ewing, the
then Under—Secretary of State for Air, on 10 June 1958. I therefore
assume that such figures can be made publically available.

DS—8 has repeatedly stated that all reports of UFOs received by the

MoD prior to 1962 have been destroyed. ”If there had been any

evidence or important papers the records would have been retained,”

I was told in November 1980 by — (Your ref: D/DS8/75/2/IJ).
Since I have now obtained a number of Air Ministry reports prior to

1962 from the Public Records Office, may I assume that the MoD‘s
assertion is demonstrably_untrue,and that I am now in possession of
”important papers”?

I thank you in advance for your trouble, and remain,

Yours faithfully
