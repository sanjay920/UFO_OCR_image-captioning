With apologies for ruining your summer I attach a letter that

Lord Trefgarne has received from Admiral of the Fleet Lord Hill—Norton
in reply to Lord Trefgarne's letter of 17 July. You will see

that Lord Hill—Norton accepts the offer of a meeting and we will

be in touch with him shortly to arrange this. I will let you know

the time and place as soon as possible, and in the meantime I

should be most grateful if you could set in hand,a’briefing for Lord
Trefgarne in the form of answers to Lord Hill—Norton's specific
questions a—e.
