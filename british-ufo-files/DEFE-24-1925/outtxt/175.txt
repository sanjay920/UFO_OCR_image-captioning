Photo, Left. This one
couli also be siad to
be due to a camera .
But although it wouﬁ:
nise to be able to ex-
plain aWay this one as
that, there still is an
air of mystery about the
line formation which
could not account for
a camera image effect.
Of course, it may have
been a guenuine UFO
which is OUT OF FOCUS
anyway. As I have not
seen the orginal stbry
or negatives, or fiih.
it is really guesswork.

SI do not know if they hays street lamps in Iran of this shape
:an enterprising student need not have made his clever fake i
iIran. I have seen many photos of UFO{s since 1954, and have n
{seen one shaped like this. In fact, I produced a similar 'UFO

‘The 'windows' in this object may be air vents to let out surp

heat of the lamp. Most street lights are now made in white pl
tic material. Again, I do not have the whole story that went

gwith this photo, or the original negative. Therefore, unless
‘CNK has any more ‘evidence' on this one, we are saying it is
inothing more than a hoax.

This is a classic. I
NOT know why this is
classified as a UFO.
There are TWO possib
