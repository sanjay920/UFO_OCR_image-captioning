Thank you for your report on 2 June 1985 to‘RAF Upavon of an
object you were unable to identify. I should explain that the sole
interest of the Ministry of Defence in reported sightings of
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) is to establish whether they have
any bearing on the defence of the country.

In order for us to establish whether there are any defence
implications, we make every effort to take account of all available
information. It is sometimes useful if we can see any photographs
which are taken and I should therefore be most grateful if you
be willing to send us the photograph you took, together with the
negative if possible. I will, of course, return both photo and
negative in due course.

Yours sincerely
