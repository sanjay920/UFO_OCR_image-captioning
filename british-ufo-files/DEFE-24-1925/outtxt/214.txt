Dear Sir,

With reference to the above named subject;

After reading with some interest the Exeter eExpress newspaper repo t anC
confirm tion of the lights by several indep nde.t scirces, this is a direct
request for information, pertaining to this 9incident.

1) It would appear the liQ t source was of ex tram size in relation to
ground observation. This being the case, how does Civil and Militar"
advanced radar, receive no indication of the subject image?

2) In ~H1 ght refueling does take place in this vicinity, yet he local
R.A.F. base, claims no knowledge of such an operation. Does this
imply, a genuine unknown tar~et was in the localitv?

5) Does R.A.F . Chivenor agree that this multi-wit 5
unknown, portray. vnusual airborne ight configurat s
in the opinion of Chivenor, do you feel the ligats were re; esentat ive

OI?

The strange concealment of infor mation surroundi‘g this case, as worried many
civilians, and I do not think for one moment, both Exeter Air901l a12d your
base failed to track the unknown. Exeter Airport slain this is a matter for
the Police and Military, if this is the case, such a large sized strucéure
should have been recognise‘.

Thank you for your v9.1uab1e time, the informat on supp ied vili be used for
research purposes only. If Chivenor submi p rt to SEC AS) 2, we wouli
be grateful :or your si Qal (copy). Low
