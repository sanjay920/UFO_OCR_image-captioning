U‘, continue_ a when pressed, a Ministry spokesman told
me:
”We accept that reports were made bieﬁlnes rational people,
A hundred people do not imagine they saw something.
"But no physical evidence was found that anything has happen
ned.
"We only investigate UFOs to find whether there is a threat
to our defences.
”If there is no threat, that is the end of the matter. We
do not inve stigate whether UFOs exist or what causes them.”
Asked who decided there was no danger to highly sensitive
defence areas, the spokesman added: "We are not prepared to
discuss how we investigate.”
CNK SAYS: The reason for this is obvoius. THEY CAN'T INVEST—
IGATE. THAT WAS A FOB'—YOU —OFF ANSWER. THEY CAN' T INVE STI-
GATE UFO° IE ,(a) they ARE a man made top secret machine
being tested. out for the last 25 years or so and (b) If the
UFO is of extraterrestrail origin, nn government on earth
has the power to'invtaiigate such a device. Nations are
powerless against such craft. And because of this lack of
power to 1nVestigate, the public are given hogwash from
the MOD and other departments. It wouldn't be good puk»
lie relations would it, if the public knew that UFOs
CAN'T BE controlled by the MOD or anybody else. That would
make them look WEAK in their eyes. This then may be the
theory behind why such answers are given out by all ‘
governments, because they have no control over a ‘potential
enemy.‘ TRUE MOD?or what do you say to that? Or is the
broken recorg, orepaizott still- .in operation?
