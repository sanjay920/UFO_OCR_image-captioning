Thank you for your letter of the 8th July.

Your deductions are correct. Our ATC did'hiearipf'reports' of "siationaryf
lights“ and there were no corresponding stationary returns on our radar.
We would not expect any, of course, since our radar eliminates stationary
targets; this is a common feature of most modern radars.

We do see a great deal of traffic that we have nothing to do with; not
surprising, since the radar covers an area of about 10,000 square miles.

aréa,’3b3urd £ﬁ0ugh this failure may seem to you.-
