Reference: D/Sec(AS)/12/3 dated 23 Aug 85

1. At Reference ou sought advice from GE 3 to assist with your
response 120* from the "official British Branch of Contact

International (for Humberside)." GE 3 has passed our re uest to me
for action. Whilst I have no way of verifying H
credentials, nor even wish to as they sound mildly pornographic, and
therefore am unable to determine if he should be passed details of
the aircraft operating from RAF Wyton, I believe that there is a

simple unclassified way to supply information on the airspace
structure around Wyton.

2. Most of the information requested by— is clearly
shown on a Royal Air Force Flight Information Publication entitled

En Route Low Altitude — British Isles South" (Chart code numbered
4lZS—L) which can be purchased from No l Aeronautical Information
Documentation Unit (No l AIDU) at RAF Northolt. A legend explaining
the symbology used on the chart is also available. Both documents
are unclassified and readily available (at a cost). Further
information, if required, can be obtained from DC No l AIDU at
Northolt (Ext 212).

3. I hope this information will be of use in the preparation of
your response.
