the sky. it seemed to still look like night with the moon shining very bright, giving off a green reflective light. at first, i thought it was a star because it was very bright. then it looked as if it was headed my direction so then i assumed it was a plane. my eyes were locked into the sky not really knowing what to comprehend. i lit up another cigarette, and just kept looking at the general direction the object was. the ufo was very far away in the sky, not entirely sure how far but up there in the sky. i found it unusual the object or ufo, whatever you call it, moved into the opposite direction it was headed initially, which was towards me. i knew instantly then was i was looking at but still was confused but i believe in extraterrestrials and would never believe that i had a chance to see this event happen in my life. i called my friend up and told him, we facetimed, and i was like \"bruh, i think i see a ufo, im pretty damn sure\" i changed the viewing from my face towards the object in the sky. i used the moon as another object as my point of reference. from his point of view, he saw the moon and another light as well. i'm pretty sure he couldn't be able to see as clear as i did. i told him i'll call him back and then around 6:23 am i started to take pictures, burst pictures, and videos of my iphone. towards the end i recorded a 15 minute video. i took a lot of photos and videos which clearly shows the object moving in different directions, left to right, right to left, towards me, away from me, going in circles, up and down. also when i was taking some pictures and videos, it somewhat distorted some parts of videos and pictures. also i zoomed in when recording and taking pictures but initially, recording was fine but than almost became static but then reverted back to normal. also the object seemed to disappear and then reappear. i could tell it was trying to hide or tried to camouflage, but i could still tell that the object was there because of its outline, even though it seemed not to appear there, it still had its outline. sometimes the became some sort of ball shape, changed its colors, disappeared and then reappeared. i never took my eyes of it and never stopped recording and taking pictures. towards the end, i thought it disappeared but appeared again and then finally disappeared. for the majority of the time, it was a bright light. also excuse my language in my video, i live in oakland, raised in the bay so my lango is different. also i showed me tenant when he came out to go to work, around that time it was getting light with which it was hard to see with the naked eye but through the camera i was still able to spot it. he also saw the object through my phone when i was recording. hopefully you can just mute some

on a radio tower only they are different, brighter, and appeared to be moving at the same rate we were along the roadside above the tree line at about 300 feet. i asked peter if he sees what i see and he too confirmed that it was really happening before our eyes. there were 3 vertical white/amberish lights with a weird cloud like fog or glow below them. they are moving a bit faster than we are at about 35 m.P.H. or so until we come to a stoplight. the 3 lights begin to morph or compress into 2 lights then 1 light, still with this weird foggy glow below them. the glow was constant until the 3 lights became 1 light then the glow surrounded the light & faded away. the center light became very small and looked exactly like a star and it stopped moving. we commented on how clever this seemed because it truly modelled itself to blend right in with the other stars in the sky. we kept our eyes on it, exhilarated at what we both were witnessing together. just then a much bigger glow appeared around the star and a much bigger elliptical 45degree angle glow also faded into view, it was huge, it took up our entire field of view through the front windshield. the glows all appeared to me like an aurora borealis kind of plasma energy, it took on a slightly bluish tint. our light signal turns green and we turn left heading east on sumpter rd..Then the star became much brighter and began to expand and split just like a cell does when it grows under a microscope. it split into two symmetrical distinct balls of light with these outer ring glows, we were really getting excited about what we are witnessing and i pull the car over to get a better look, just as we slow to a stop, the glows and lights expand at the same rate a firework display does, only it stays perfectly symmetrical in it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds expansion. we can see streaks inside of the plasma ball glow, that squiggle and move a bit like electricity. we are both gasping and our expressions are pretty hilarious as we are oh, my god\ufffd\ufffd\ufffding and , what the #@!% is that. then the entire formation imploded or shrank an a fraction of a second and simply vanished!\nno trace after 1/2 second. it simply vanished. we both had goosebumps from head to toe and were astonished at how big this was for us, and how long event took right near a busy intersection prime time on a friday night. many cars were around us and driving, i choose to know if they were looking up and saw it. surely as big as this was somebody else must have seen it too.  this is an experience that confirmed for me what i felt in my heart. we are being visited by other worldly energies, and or craft. no scientific explanation can begin to explain what this was. whatever it was... it truly was in and then out of this world, in less than a second!\n\nwe called people we knew from the school and heard that many of the students and families leaving the event also witnessed the event, and they told us the consensus was it was the space shuttle. to which we thought was ridiculous, but hey as bizzare and life altering this was for me, i can imagine that people would try to rationalize and justify such an amazing phenomena.\n\ni am a graphic designer and immediately came home with my friend peter and recreated in photoshop exactly what we saw and the timings it happened in so we would verify and validatebetween the two of us the accuracy of our event. we showed it to our family and a few friends, and then put it aside. i felt it was time to share it. i recently edited the images into a video

in landing nearby or lower. \n \ni can tell it / they are going to go right over head soon. so i run to get my daughter. i figured she is 15 and would be believed as a witness. someone else had to see this so i didn't sound crazy. so since it wasn't going very fast i took the chance. we run back out and it is almost right over head. as we look at it you can see there is more to it than just lights. it made no sound. it was definately something or things there. not birds or balloons,helicoptors or a jet. my daughter gets scared and runs inside after about 20 seconds. i had to watch it. it almost looked like that they were either one thing or so close together it looked like one solid thing. then another one of those shooting star things flys off from the front of it. \nas soon as that happened it suddenly sped up the lights in front start to disappear and then it just was gone.\n\ni am stunned. can't workout what i just saw. i rush inside to hear what my daughter saw. she is sitting on the couch in a blanket shaking and scared. she said she thought it was low and one solid object with the lights either in or on it. it made no noise and  was not birds. i had to ask her if that could have been what we saw. she said there was no way it was birds.\ni go back outside of course and start looking up again because i am trying to stay calm. she asks me to come back in and

approaching from almost to do north which continued to last  close to 45 seconds to 55 seconds so long that we were able to call out her friend from her cabin to come out and witness this occurrence as well which maybe we shouldn't because she got really freaked out and me and my daughter proceeded to have a conversation about why that's not an airplane and how old it was  because it was completely dead so i went outside and you could almost always hear some type lights off in the distance as soon as we noticed that and then we're discussing it we could start to hear planes approaching from all the way to the north again which is our left and another plane that's coming all the way from a right which were flying about three times as high as this double fireball thing and i was thinking how weird it was that the planes didn't notice it but then i realize that it was way lower altitude than what they were and they can't see underneath them selves it was just super weird

first time i noticed it was about midnight the morning of oct. 21 or 22 2005. i can't exactly remember because the event happens everynight. i was watching a movie downstairs in my basement and went to smoke a cig. i am a person who has also been interested in astronomy my entire life and am fascinated in the stars. as i gazed into the night sky, i noticed an unusually bright star in the sky. the star had a bright faintly blue band across it and a faintly visible, transparent halo around it. figuring it to be mars at first because i know that mars was the most visible planet in the sky at that time, i stared in wonder. then it came to me that mars appears almost dark orange. this was bright yellow with a faintly orange tint, and last i checked, doesn't have a band across it. so i started assuming saturn because jupiters ring isn't visible with the naked eye. then it wobbled and slightly dropped. stars nor planets descend in the night sky and wobble. i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and rubbed them and began to look again. then when i compared it to the moon, it was lower. this thing was in the air. i refused to believe what i thought i was thinking so lit another cig and continued to observe. i noticed it was drifting and then it appeared to start a direct, very slow, almost unnoticable decent towards me and stop. \n\ni must say this.I am a former us marine. my mos was avionics technician f-18's. i have seen many different types of aircraft both military and civilian and none of them hover anything like this, and none are dead silent. they also have multiple lights that flash in an arranged pattern. this thing was bright, one solid color, silent, and the band i saw at first, is not a band. its extremities, but not wings. it also began to appear as either 2 seperate balls on top of each other joined by this blue colored now v shaped joint is the best way to describe it, or a longer type object. it was hard to distinguish because it would change slightly when it drifted to a slightly different position. it appeared to move in a manner to try to remain unnoticable, but i could tell. i went inside and grabbed my moms cell phone camera and went back outside and was suprised to see it there still, though it had shifted to a slightly different position but same general location. i struggled to snap off 2 different shots as it was very difficult to get it on the tiny little display, and i'm still not sure if i got it or not. after about an hour, i started second guessing myself and walked inside shaking my head almost laughing at myself that i even thought i saw what i think i saw. was i going crazy???\nyeah, i must have been tired and my mind was playing tricks on me. after all, don't ufo's move really fast at odd flight patterns and only last a few seconds at best. they're also supposed to have lights and zip around and do neat little tricks. they also don\"t start backing up when you aim a camera at it!!What do they care if you snap a few shots.\n\nthe next night, same day, i ate dinner and went outside again to smoke. i looked up to the same spot i had witnessed it the night before and of course i saw nothing. i began to laugh at myself at what i saw the night before. in geberal curiosity i thought, what the hell. i'll walk around my house while i smoke and just see. as i walked i a glimpse of a light the same color and brightness that i had seen the night before peering through a small gap in the top of the tree line to my left. it was dusk and still a little light remained. again as it had been that morning the sky was crystal clear. i moved further up my driveway thinking to myself that there was no possible way that i was seeing that thing again. i got to the front of my house and plain as day their it was, craddled between the bowl shaped gap in the tree line. now, i had a reference field to all but the top side and it sat directly in the center. it didn't take nearly as long to see it move this time as it had before. it was going left and right, up and down in a wobblly manner. i ran inside and got my parent to come out and see. sure enough, they both saw it. it wasn't making large movements, but very noticable comparing to the trees around it. then it moved up over the tree line and slightly left out of the clearing and continued to hover. it was at about a 45 degree angle and i assumed it to be about 20000 feet or so due to its size. i ran inside and grabbed the digital camera this time and my binoculars. i started to aim, but again had trouble getting it to show up on the display. so i just started to point and took a couple of guess shots. by this time it was dark, and stars had started to appear. i went in and downloaded this first batch to my comp. i was absolutly amazed at what came out. the picture resembled nothing like what i saw. the image was red and moving around very rapidly. you can tell because it resembled a still traffic shot. i thought that may have been the slight movement of my hand, but in a few of the other shots, there are 2 stars in the background, 1 blue, 1 green. i went back out and watched in disbelief and awe as i took a few more shots over the past hour and a half. again, it never left. i had called the nuforc and left a message and emailed them the pics.\n\nthe next day, i got call from them. this was a monday. the so called scientist that spoke to me insisted it was mars and hadn't even looked at my pictures. he had a bad attitude and completly blew me off belittling me the entire time. i wanted to say something really bad but he hung up before i could retort.\n\nok. thats the beginning of a very long story that grows day by day for almost a month now, non stop, every night, all night. from sun down till i don't know how long, assuming sun up. brief summery of things since.As i have taken more pics (over 200) and watched, now i have a telescope, i have been able to detect many other things going on. theres more than 1 in the sky. there is a peremeter. they post in different positions and no matter where i go on my property, which is about 2 acres that is very open then extends into a fence of thin woods, neighborhoods around at a distance, a dark sky, and road that brdges 2 kinda busy roads about 5 miles from the interstate that gets dead at night. in some of the pics, you can see orbs as well as the objects being photographed. you can tell they are 3-d and have indentions. i discovered them by mistake as they are invisible (or were to me until now) when i looked at one of the pics i took by mistake when i couldn't get the camera to flash and began to point it at a differnt spot and it went off. this pics is one of my favorites. they look like the diagrams of cells you see in biology books and it even appears that they are splitting! there tons of them and they where all around me!! i had no clue. i can see them now, but they appear as just circles in which the area i see them is slightly fainter and distorted compared to the rest of the sky. i see many shadows that buzz past and flashes that shot by. i have pictures of this too. sometimes i can see what looks like a tiny diamond that sparkles very sharply just in the air no more than 10 feet away and at sternum level with me. whenever i stare at that and take my focus off the surrounding area, i can see a figure that looks like the shape of a small human. this is not like the typical description of the greys that i have heard so much about. they are about 4 feet tall, some shorter than others, and they will not approach me. if i get closer than a few steps towards it, it vanishes like it just fades into the area behind it like a chammeleons blends in with the color of its surroundings, but when i step back, reappears. these are very real beings that have the technology or ability to do this, like camoflouge. there heads are properly proportioned to there bodies, and there eyes are black, but not as slit as they are oval and on towards the top of there head, like a bug almost, but human. also the very top of there eyes appear slightly reflect light like a pair of sunglasses has that tiny bright spot where the sun reflects off. they observe every move i make and are everywhere i am at night, and can point them out to anybody, at least the crafts that i think are more or less personal transport units.They have no facial features other than eyes and almost look like kermit the frog in the face. i have a picture of this as well that i took inside my house looking out because the first time i thought i trully saw it it looked liked something was peering through my window, and more than one. i had very mixed emotions about the pic because i tried to regard the images i saw as reflections of like out the window. but i showed it to several people and my best friends who lived with me for a week and saw almost everything i saw, and still can like me, though he is in the mountains, have concluded that the images are real. this was primarily based on comparing the shots we took in my jeep when we got some daylight pics in the subdivision down by my house. when we left we got on the interstate and took some shots while in motion and window up in a few and only got 1 flash with no images of kermit looking creatures peering back. i must correct myself. in the picture with the image, there are 2. one right at my window peering from through the bottom, with a reflective flash off its peeering eyes, and another image in the back to the right that had very serious eyes that were slightly more slanted and slit and looked more like it was watching the other figure like a boss observes his subordinate.\n\nthere ones in the woods that look exactly like the watcher one in the air as i first decribed from day 1, but they seem to have a different task. they analyze, everything. study everything around them to the last detail with what looks just like a double lens laser pointer that emits either 1 or 2 either red or white dots on whatever it is looking at, including you! i have watched them before and seen the dots appear on me. they stay back and do their own thing, almost always in the same spot just floating slightly around. i have now noticed in the past 2 days a different one. this character at first looked like a a small cloud with whitish yellow sparkles. when i got a good look at it with binoculars in tree line gaps, i can tell it has a definite shape, like a human wearing buffy clothes, and the sparkles dont sparkle but are a constants glow placed in very specific places and when they appear to move very wildly about it, that it it moving that part of it body. he seems to be top dog because he points his little beams at the other guys and they react. also, when i stare at him for more than a few seconds with binoculars, those little dots start appearing on me. i also feel things start to get all around me and get what feels like a forced sense of overwhelming paranoia. thats when i also see the figures that i mentioned earlier that at first look like floating diamonds. i need to get a picture of him, need a new chip for digital camera cuz my other one is loaded up. they really got pissed when i pointed my telescope at him. i decided that might not be a good idea, and took it back in until i can asses that a little better.\n\ni at first wanted to remain unanimous, but after emailing coast to coast, and oops, the cia, about this matter, in which that was a while back and far less detailed, and no response from anybody, i want to get into this field and research the hell out of it.Especially because since i informed the cia, you can't go more than 1 second without seeing either an f-18, i know them from the bottom and light patterns because i worked on them, recon plane with its spotter lights for taking nighttime aerial photos, a helocopter or some other military aircrafts like those used by the fbi or dea to watch people from above, and most of the time they fly at very low altitudes and very slowly over my house.\n\nthis is not a joke. i would like from somebody to please at least look at these pics. you can send an investigator out to my house if you wish any night you choose and you will see i'm very serious about this. i have nowhere else to turn. i had given up actually until i saw your web sight. i have been thing very extensivly about creating an organizations that follows up on these kind of reports that everybody, including so called ufoologist such as the one that didn't even give me the time of day despite the fact i have many pictures, yet goes off claims in which no evidence other than a single persons testimony is provided. that just blows my mind and makes me think no wonder why we can't publically prove life exists outside this planet.I have come to the conclusion that the government not only knows about these occurances, but will not do anything about it except do anything they can to deny it and discredit or shut up those who can prove it. it will be up to us, as citizens, to stand up to this. it will take undenialble proof and i want to get as involved as i can in the field as humanly possible after exeriencing this.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/4109_submitter_file1__TheUFO10and112005127.jpg",

going west to east . we have been keeping track of it for two weeks or more now . it has slowly changed it\u2019s location.  this was the same star that i was trying to photograph when this other

"summary": "On friday march 16, 2018 i was walking my dog along the greenbelt on the northern side of veterans memorial park in cedar park, texas. the loop around the park is about 1 1/3 miles total. an aviation buff and lifelong sky watcher, i noticed a white/silver metallic sphere moving at a high rate of speed tracking roughly south to north at an estimated 10-15,000 above ground level. there was no exhaust or visible means of propulsion in a standard sense. while holding my dog\u2019s leash i grabbed my mobile phone out of my pocket to attempt to record some video before the sphere would be lost in my line of sight over the tree line. the video is terrible since i was juggling the dog leash and fighting with the sun glare on my phone. there are only a few frames of the object. i have seen the same type of sphere moving at a fast speed a few years before, ironically, while walking my dog at the park. it is only because of the following activities that i was prompted to get this event documented.\n\nafter losing sight of the object i continued around the trail wondering whether what i witnessed was advanced human technology or something otherworldly. minutes later at approximately 12:07 while walking southbound on the western side of the greenbelt, i heard a low hum and looked left and up. at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet i saw what i\u2019m convinced was an air force c-17 globemaster, a huge four engine cargo jet. in nearly four years of living in central texas, i\u2019ve never seen one before. it was tracking the same south to north direction of the flying metallic sphere, but approximately two miles east. i could only wonder if the c-17 was tracking the sphere, or it had released the sphere itself in some military test, or if seeing the two in the space of 7 minutes was coincidental.\n\ntwo days later, on sunday march 18, 2018, i was, again, walking my dog around the park. while walking northbound on the east side of the park i began to hear a low rumble and recognized the sound of military helicopters. only occasionally do you see any military choppers over cedar park, even given that the us army base fort hood is only 45 air miles away north northeast. i stopped and looked around for the choppers. this was 11:22 a.M. central. what i believe were two apache attack choppers were about one-half mile south from location and traveling west at approximately 3,000 feet above ground level. they were flying close together with the lead chopper staggered to the left of the other. what happened next made my jaw dropped the lead chopper abruptly jerked the chopper right (north) over roughly the same track the metallic sphere had been flying two days earlier. the lead chopper\u2019s move must have come to a surprise to the back chopper, because there was nearly a mid-air collision. the two choppers continued that course until i lost sight of them because of the tree line. just as i was getting to my car to load my dog and head home, i heard another low hum at 11:32 a.M. flying the same course west as the other two choppers was a lone apache. and it made the same move (but smoother) of heading north along the track of the other choppers and the metallic sphere two days earlier.\n\ni have no idea as to what these events mean. i can only chalk them up to high strangeness at this time.", "photos":

clearly seeing two planes but a third object ahead of them darker and smaller didn't seem to be a third plane. trees and horizon blocked my sight as they flew over to the north. came back inside and starting looking to magnify the photos and noticed the dark object they were following in the photos to blurry for me to really see anything marking or even basic shape. i showed these photos to family they weren't to sure what the third object was either.\n\n for years the a-10s have had training flights right over my house every at least once or twice a year, this was the first i've seen this year. there has always seemed to be just two a-10s that i've seen flying in formation using the farms and silos as targets, they usually branch out over both roads after crossing over my house. the sounds just seemed different this time to me. if needed i will search for the past photos of a-10s flying over head.\n\nthis time you can see in the photos they are both heading the same way after a dark object. one planes appears to be changing course to follow object. i hope the photos can be of help because it just looks to blurry for me and therefore less credible. i have the white photo but didn't attach for the sake of file space you allow, i also attached the nef file versions in case they are better info for you.\n\nstill feeling very sure of how i recalled and wrote this all. during the event i was calm but had energy to move fast to get the position to take the photo. i got a little perked up when i saw the third object that i couldn't make out before i even looked at the photos. as for now i'm still a little unsure that i should be making this all out like mountains out of ant hills.", "photos":

"My wife and i were traveling south on trooper road (route 363) towards the intersection at egypt road in our personal automobile for a late supper, as i had just returned home from work.\n\ni spotted a bright orange orb relatively high in the sky traveling slowly in a horizontal straight line in a se direction, making its way over the home depot and walmart in audubon. i'd say the orb was at least 4 or 5 times brighter that the planet venus when venus is at its brightest.\n\ni pulled out my iphone while i was driving and attempted to video the orb in the sky. i did this twice, but apparently was unsuccessful, as i was trying to do this while i was driving in traffic. i had it on the screen of my iphone for at least 10 seconds at one point, but perhaps i didn't engage the video button on the screen, as i was continuously looking back and forth between the object and the car in front of me.\n\nthe orb then just faded from view while over the industrial park just south of the shopping center. it didn't go into clouds, and didn't speed away - the luminosity just turned off while the object was in place in the sky over the industrial park.\n\nwhile our car was approaching the intersection at egypt road, a white light, slightly smaller than a golf ball, appeared out of nowhere and headed straight for our car, traveling about 4 feet above the payment until it was about 10 feet in front of the vehicle, then it shot straight up into the sky. i thought it might have been a large insect, but frankly i believe it was too cold that night for insects to be flying around, and the movement of the object was too fast and the path too straight. i'd estimate the entire duration of this sighting to be all of about a second.\n\nthe orange orb was still up in the sky and remained there while this other stuff was going on. i'd say the orb was visible in the sky for at least 5 minutes.\n\nwhen i got to the restaurant, i was disappointed to see that the video i thought i had taken of the orb was non-existent. what i did have however, was 1.2 seconds of video that i did not even remember taking. it showed two small white lights moving fast and erratically.\n\ni enhanced the video from the original, and ultimately slowed it down to the point where i'm thinking the lights may have been birds - but i'll let you be the judge of that. i included the original video, plus two versions that i digitally enhanced in an effort to better see what was going on.\n\nanyway, when you look at the videos, notice the white light to the right of the street lamp in the right-center of the frame. then there's a second white light streaking across the frame  that stops right above that same street light when the video ends.\n\nbut for me, the real mystery remains the bright orange orb in the sky, and even after posting about the experience on social networking, i've not found anyone else who has seen it - other than my wife. frankly, with all of the cars out on the road and with the busy parking lots at the shopping centers, i don't know how anybody could miss it.\n\ni was intrigued enough with the sighting the following day to consider calling the lower providence police to see if anyone called in the sighting, but i finally decided i didn't want to put myself through that. so i decided to file a report with you guys.\n\njust so that you know my orientation - i'm 63 years old and never experienced a ufo sighting until march 23. and i do not believe that ufos are of extraterrestrial origin. i'm sure there is a terrestrial explanation for this, and i'm just curious as to what it may be.\n\none more thing:  last summer i saw a series of similar objects hovering in a cluster slightly north of last friday's sighting, also on trooper road. while the sighting was initially startling, i finally figured out that they were probably illuminated lanterns with the air inside them heated by a candle that somebody in the adjoining neighborhood released all at once.\n\nthe object my wife and i saw on friday was not a lantern. it was higher in the sky, and looked more like a flare - like the kind used in the maritime industry for search and rescue. but there was no tail on this object. and it moved slowly and horizontally in a se direction until it extinguished.", "photos":

select it and enlarge it to see if you can recognize the eagle rock in the background. as i enlarged it i see this spec and was startled. still standing in the spot, mere seconds later i look up and there is nothing there. i never actually saw it, only in the picture. there was no helicopter, blimp, drone, jet or any noise. if it had been any one of those things it would have still been there. it was strange enough that i felt compelled to put it right into social media.  people said blimp, etc. some said a dirty lens. i knew enough about cameras that if it was a spec on my lens that it wouldn\u2019t look like this. it would be blurry and not hard edges, and pixelating when enlarged. i even did an experiment later that day. i put a rather large piece of black pepper in the center of my lens and took a pic of the sky. i was correct, it was so blurry that the camera basically focuses around it and it become a large darker portion of the sky eliminating the spec on my lens theory.

split second of video of this object and it is covering a ton of ground in the tiny moment! it comes from the far right side of my lens to where it rests in the photo in that split second. that\u2019s

"summary": "Ok let's begin. we were visiting a friend of ours that lived in the apartments next to where the ufo encounter started for us. we visited for awhile and then our friend went to bed. at that time it was really late, way after 2am. we were both into astronomy and so we decided to sit on the ground next to the apartment(west side of building) and stargaze. we were looking at the stars and admiring the beauty of it all. and it's important to note that from our vantage point we were looking in the eastern sky. after about two hours we were looking up i noticed a white star that seemed a little unusual. it was bigger than all the rest of the stars and there was something about it that didn't seem right and it got my attention. i told my friend to look at the unusual star and so we both starred at it. the star was up about 40 to 45 degrees from the horizon. we were starring and watching this unusual white star for at least 30 minutes. as we were watching this unusually bright star, the rays of the star began to get bigger and bigger. which we both looked at each other in amazement and astonishment. the rays of what appeared to be a bright white star began to almost come directly at us or it appeared that way. as this was going on the wind began to pick up and we heard some rustling in the tall dead grass next to us. we both got a little frightened after that since the rays of the star was unusual enough. we both proceeded to get up from sitting on the ground and try and see if our friend that lived in the apartment was still awake or not. we were going to tell him about the unusually bright star. we couldn't get anyone to answer the door that early in the morning. we then proceeded to go knock on another person's door that he knew that was directly across from the other apartment we were just at. at this point a few hours had passed. as he was opening up the metal screen door to his other friends apartment i was behind him. something caught my attention and we then both turned around looking up and witnessed a large object coming out of the sky. we both were in amazement. we walked out away from the apartment and slightly towards whatever was coming out of the sky. then all i can remember is that there was this blackish grey triangular craft gliding over the top of us. time seemed to slow down at this point. as it was going over us i got a good look at it. it had one small red light directly in the middle of the craft. it had three slightly larger white lights on each corner of the craft. i also noticed that there was multicolored lights moving in between the white lights. like in a pulsating pattern. i remember as the craft was floating over us we both were saying, \"wow\" in total amazement and astonishment. i remember feeling that there was this low humming vibration going through my body and concentrating in my chest.(later on my friend confirms this as well)there was a really low sound but this may have been this low humming sound/vibration. as it floated over us i remember watching it float/glide away from us and again it seemed like an eternity as we both watched it float away. i remember feeling sad that it was going away. we then watched it float up and over these nearby houses. it was moving very slow. in my mind i was thinking that it almost looked unreal at how it was floating and moving up and over the houses.\nwe then frantically went back to his car(chevell) and got in. we just sat there with our jaws open and not saying a word, except for \"did you see that\". as we were pondering in disbelief as to what just occurred we both started to feel as though we were telepathically communicating with each other. this was shocking and scary to us. we almost couldn't look at each other. he then said that he just saw some symbols on my forehead. which was really strange to me. and if the ufo encounter wasn't strange enough. we sat there in his car for a long time trying to take all of the experience in. we were both still in a state of shock. we both agreed that we wouldn't say anything to each other about what we just experienced and that we both would draw on a piece of paper what we saw when he dropped me off at my house. at this point i remember as we were sitting in his car that a trash truck was coming up to the apartments and began to take the trash. we both thought this was unusual and we were thinking why a trash truck would be working this early in the morning. so at this point the time had to have been in the early hours before the sun was to come up. he then proceeded to take me to my house and drop me off. there wasn't alot of talking between us as we were still trying to process what had happened to us. when we pulled up in the front of my house we both agreed to draw what we had witnessed. he got out a piece of small paper which i think it was a receipt and he ripped it in half. he gave me a pencil and we both began to draw what we had seen. we then looked at each other's drawing and it was an exact match. a triangle craft with one light in the middle and three on each corner.\nwe just sat there in disbelief. we said our good byes and i went into my house to go to bed since it was getting light out. \nso that's the main part of the ufo encounter me and my friend had. \nnow on to the rest...\nthe next afternoon we contacted each other on the phone and as we were discussing the incident some very unusual memories began to emerge. for one we both remember seeing the highway and a bunch of red tail lights going north on the highway. there was a bunch of emergency vehicles going north on 55hwy. and the memory is up in the air somehow looking down and north towards the highway. also the tail lights seemed blurred or elongated. but was definitely a birds eye view of the highway going north. the strange thing is is that from where we were at at the time of the encounter there's no way physically possible to see the highway. this is very strange to me. \nanother strange thing is that about a week later i was working as a janitor at a school mopping the floors when all of a sudden this thought of a blueprint of some sort came into my mind. i don't remember what it was or meant but i talked to my friend at the time about it and he said the same thing happened to him. so that's a mystery as to whether it was related to our encounter. and we weren't sure whether we was abducted but we may have been. that would account for seeing the tail lights go down the highway.\n\none final note i want to add is that my friend said that after he dropped me off he went into the 711 right up the road from the apartments and there was emergency personnel in the gas station talking about something. i'm assuming they got word of the incident from it being reported or saw the craft as well. \n\ni'm also willing to take a polygraph test if necessary.", "photos":

to let my two dogs out in the backyard which is paralell with interstate 20 in weatherford tx, as i approached the backyard at around this time of night it is almost pitch black outside because of nearby bussiness's that turn off their lights completely to save money i'm geussing.. almost every light except for a few in every mile is off around this time including the big advertising signs that are across the street from my house so the night sky is very beautiful at this time, being able to see constellations very clearly. well right before i was going to open my sliding door to let my dogs out i had noticed two strange pulsating lights traveling towards me, because as i stared at them i was in awe and also trying to figure out if they were just airplanes or maybe choppers but then i noticed that these objects had pulsating lights that seem to have changed colors from a white to a orange then from orange to a red and from red to gold it was pulsating but strangely turning colors at a very slow rate like nothing i have seen before, so as i was in awe just watching them i saw the object to the left started to change direction in a zig zagging pattern and all of a sudden it went from being close range to the other object to almost immediately traveling a great distance to the west and descending as it traveled then it just hovered and slowley traveled west and then came to a stop and hovered at a distance while the other object was traveling toward my house as i focused my attention on the closer object it started to take shape because of how close it was getting. again i was in complete awe so i just stood there watching this object pulsate the same kind of lights as the other one and was zig zagging at slow rate till it got closer then again this object came to a complete stop and hovered about 40 degrees from my sight i could tell it completely stopped because it was on the the other side of a electrical poll in my backyard so i could tell if it was moving or not about a couple minutes of just standing there watching i started to notice almost like a faint beam come down from the bottom of the top shape object and about four or five white orbs started coming out of the bottom of this object at that point i was getting kind of freaked out because i have never seen anything like this before in my life. i was in the marine corps and had seen my fair share of aircraft,flares and explosives etc.. so as this was happening i ran in the house from my porch and got my phone to try to capture what was happening i was only gone for about a minute, but when i returned i could only see both of the bigger objects but none of the orbs that had dispersed. so before these were gone i wanted to get some pictures on my phone. unfortunately i thought my camera and video camera would have caught a decient picture or video but it just was not suffient enough to get good details or shapes just little dots in the sky if i tried to take a good photo but i will still include them below. besides the camera i actually had gone outside and was able to continue to observe these objects at a hover in the sky for the next 15 minutes or so before disappearing completely from view. after this first sighting i saw only one object within the next week or so in the same part of the sky with the same lights and shape but in different directions and altitude.",

it as one object. there were about 7 tiny red lights. it was completely stationary and silent. the only apparently stationary things i have ever seen in the sky aside from astronomical bodies were helicopters that sometimes hover very loudly over some incident taking place on the ground. the lights were twinkling as a faint star would. they have to be pretty far way to twinkle. for example the lights on the world trade center (a few miles south) twinkle as viewed from 26th street and 5th avenue. the lights were about as bright as the little red lights on a crane would be high above a city street (more dim than bright) so i checked carefully to see if this was something like that. but clearly no cranes visible. the weird thing was it was a little windy and that thing was yet as still as if fixed to something solid. i went inside to get my binoculars but couldn't find them and i decided, due to ambient lighting, i would not get a very good picture of it. in retrospect i suppose i should have tried to. but i did check to see if it was still there and it was. but then about a half hour later it was not there. i also waited to see if there were any reports of a ufo but there were

it was because the thought never occurred to me until now, but i can still clearly picture the event as if it happened yesterday.\n\nat the time, i was living in a rural area near the town i specified in the report.  we decided to go into town and buy dinner from a restaurant rather than cook something at home.  i was with one other person, who was driving the vehicle, as we went into town as we so often did.  it was late evening and the sun was going down.  our order at the restaurant took an abnormally long time to prepare, so by the time we were heading back home it was dark out and we could see the stars above us.\n\nwe were driving back home to the rural area where we lived when the event took place.  we were driving on the highway specified in the report, and up until the event our view of the sky to the southwest was obstructed by tall trees.  then as we took a turn and the area to our left opened up, we could see what looked at first to be like a very tall radio or cell tower.\n\nwe both remarked to each other that we didn't remember there being a tower out there, and that's just the thing, there wasn't and still is not a tower out there.  upon realizing this, we both began to observe the object(s) more closely.\n\nthe main thing that drew our attention was a large, unwavering and immobile orange light that, from our perspective, looked to be about the size of a circular tablet of aspirin.  behind it were three smaller white lights which seemed to be hovering in formation.  the fact that the lights weren't moving or flashing indicated to us that we weren't simply seeing airplanes in the sky, and that was why we thought it was just a very tall aerial tower at first.\n\nwe observed the lights for at least five minutes as we drove on the highway, but because someone was rudely tailgating us we were not able to pull off to the shoulder and take pictures or a video.  this is the one part that i can't exactly remember; whether or not we were able to see the stars in-between the formation of lights, so i'm not sure if they were four separate objects, or if they were lights on one single craft.\n\nif it was one craft, it would have to have been absolutely massive.  the formation of the four lights made the shape of an almost triangular rhombus.  we both knew that we were seeing something strange, and although i can't speak for the other witness, i felt a sense of dread and anxiety, as if i wasn't supposed to be looking.  when we got home we talked about the odd experience for a short while before going to bed, and essentially forgot about the experience.\n\ni spoke with the other witness before making this report to verify what we had seen, and it seemed like he hadn't really thought about the experience again until i reminded him of it just tonight.  i've thought about it a few times over the years but never felt compelled to report the sighting until now.\n\nwe lost sight of the lights when we turned off of the highway on our way back home.  due to the amount of trees in the area it would have been impossible to observe the lights from where we lived.", "photos":

stumbling upon it on netflix. it seemed suitable prior to my first visit to arizona lol. after glancing through some of my girl's photos i noticed a peculiar thing in one. in the picture, taken at approximately 4pm, is two houses with a clear blue sky in the background. above the house on the left is six white spots in a slight vee pattern in the sky. after seeing the photo we looked around the inside of the vehicle to see if something could have cause a glare on the window and have simulated that in the pic and found nothing. i asked my girlfriend if she had ever heard of the phoenix lights before and she said she hadn't. my friend, who was familiar with the lights (not firsthand) and had friends that had seen other similar phenomena, looked at the photo and was immediately intrigued. after showing my girlfriend a photo of the phoenix lights sighting (found on google) and comparing it to the on she took we noticed similarities. we have no idea what is in the picture, but it is quite obviously something. i have examined this photo many times an am no further ahead in explaining it.\n\ni should have sent this to you sooner, but i wasn't aware of your organization and only found out from a friend while telling this story. i was hoping you could offer some insight and explanation to what's in this photo. unfortunately, my girlfriend never never noticed the objects when taking the picture and so only took the one pic. \n\nalthough this report is made after the fact, the date and approximate time of the event have been determined based on the image file's date and

about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon. it flew in a very straight line, slowly, then suddenly stopped. it sat there, hovering, for nearly a minute it seems, and the began to fly what seemed like straight up, gaining altitude. then, suddenly, it seemed to change direction and made what seemed to be a right angle turn and began heading east again. it flew in that direction for a little bit, maybe twenty seconds, then suddenly made another right angle turn and began to look like it was descending, losing altitude. then again it stopped. it hovered there for about a minute again, roughly about nne of me, in the direction of hollywood. then suddenly it took off, no acceleration, just immediate speed, towards the ne, it what seemed to be an acending direction towards, i guess, the

walked out and shut down the gopro. \ni downloaded the files onto my computer and really didn't think any more about it. i captured more sunrises, on other days and around the middle of february i

beam were:\n1. they seemed to be free standing. a spotlight beam can followed from the ground all the way up until no longer visible or to where it hits the cloud deck. there was absolutely no connecting beam from the bottom of the columns to the ground.\n2. the columns of light do not bounce off the cloud deck. \n3. in the full hour these were observed, they did not change in size, shape,

distance it was hard to see with much detail. when i reviewed the 40 separate photos i found there to be several distinct shapes; a perfect square, a 6 point star, a circle with an 'x' dividing it into 4 distinct and equal segments, an inverted upside down 'l', an odd geometric shape with 3 protuberances, and some other more abstract shapes as well. at one point a commercial airliner passed

to a building since i was still on my schools campus. i live in a very small town, only about 1000 people live here so there is very little light pollution. this makes the stars in the sky very visible, so when i happened to look into the sky i noticed a large chunk of it was solid black. \n     i stopped in my tracks and stared at the slowly moving black mass. my first thought was it was a giant bird of some sort, circling prey in the sky. but as i continued to stare i noticed the shape itself was not bird like but like a disc. the light from the building i was nearby reflected off the object just enough i could make out some features. the object itself was spinning very slowly while floating through the sky. i started to feel fear as my mind put the picture together. \n    i kind of always believed that there was other life in this world but i\u2019m one of those people that i don\u2019t truly let myself believe something unless i see it. i had no immediate explanation for what this object could be. and because of the way it was moving and the proximity of it, it felt almost predatory. my immediate thought was to get out of there and head indoors. my heart was racing and i kept looking up into the sky to see if it was following me. i never saw it again, i called my mother and told her exactly what i saw while i was walking. being on the phone with someone made me feel better about the situation. i haven\u2019t walked at night alone again since that night. \n   the sketch i submitted is obviously a very rough one. but you can get the idea of what i saw. the little bit of outline and detail i could see was from the reflected light from the building i was near. \n    after reviewing the night in my head for awhile i don\u2019t think the object was following me. i think it was heading somewhere and trying to keep a low profile. i just happened to be there to see it.", "photos":

before the hike i had been watching various youtube videos about ufos..Something ive always been interested in..Anyway i had a strange feeling i would see something... a feeling that has since left me. so about halfway through the hike i came to a clearing i usually stop there and have a drink of water and a snack if i'm hungry. i decided to look up...Maybe id see something..I clearly was not expecting to..But it had almost become a habit, and to my surprise as i did a reflection caught my eye. so i took my phone out and started to record.. it looked like two spheres that were circling but maintained the space between each other almost as if they were connected but separate if that makes any sense.  if you can imagine holding a tiny metal bar with 2 basketballs stuck on each end and you just twirled the middle of the stick around that's the best way i could describe these 2 objects moving through the sky hovering. i didn't know what they were so i was talking a little bit through the video maybe they were weather balloon's.. i was going through different scenarios in my mind i had seen weather balloons before and these didn't look like they were.. i was trying to think of something that fit the description but i couldnt... near the end of the video you can see and hear an airplane or some kind of jet pass below.  after the jet passed i became the bit uneasy and i decided it was time to move on so i hiked the rest of the way about a mile...As i started looking over the video when i got home i noticed two other objects that were smaller and moving extremely fast. i screenshot these at 31 seconds and 44 seconds.  if you look closely you can see these objects fly through extremely fast... i've had the video in my phone and i decided to send it to you guys.. i'm sure you have equipment that's better than my phone :) you can zoom in and adjust contrast or whatever you guys do to clear the picture and video up to make it easier to see anyway...That's pretty much it. hope the video is as interesting to you as it was to me.  ps camp bullis military training reservation is a u.S. army training camp comprising 27,990 acres in bexar county, texas, usa,

"-105.26102", "summary": "I was driving in my car with my girlfriend, victoria blackwell, beside me and my 12 year old son, alexander manyhawks wolf-toney, in the back seat. we were coming from nevin platt middle school on baseline road east of cherryvale road, where we had just picked up alexander. he got out of school at 15:30 and took a few minutes to get to the car, so i estimate the pictures were taken between 15:45 and 16:00. \n\nwe were headed west on baseline road to go to taco bell at baseline road and broadway for a snack. the low cloud formations over the flatirons were creating some memorable images, so i stopped the car just west of the foothills parkway and got my sony dsc-p41 camera out of the trunk to take some pictures. \n\nfirst we stopped in the parking lot of the st. andrew presbyterian church at 37th street and baseline road to get a clear view without the power lines going along baseline road. there was an open meadow toward the foothills there, so it was a good location. i took four shots. the first one was without zoom, the other three were zoomed to varying degrees. i estimate the time here as about three minutes total, arriving in the parking lot no sooner than 15:45.\n\n[the second shot, i just realized as i reviewed the pictures to write this report, had a ufo in it, too!!! there was a radiant diamond shape in front of the tree line on the far side of the meadow! we didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt notice that last night! so i have included this image as well as the other along with this report, and have modifed the short description narrative of the report to include this. while taking all these pictures, i was oblivious to anything ufo related going on.]\n\nafter shooting in the church parking lot, i proceeded west on baseline avenue and took two more shots; one without zoom just after leaving st. andrews and another zoomed some while near taco bell. after we went through taco bell, i went south on broadway to ash avenue, where i turned east and immediately turned north and came to a stop on the corner of ashley lane. i estimate arrival to this spot to be no earlier than 15:55. \n\nhere i had a great, unobstructed, close-up view of a stretch of the flatirons and took a slightly zoomed shot to eliminate the foreground and capture a nice scene. a few seconds later, waiting for some traffic on broadway to clear, i took a second shot of the same scene to make sure i had a good image. then we went home, a few blocks away in the martin acres neighborhood. i wish to note that all images were taken from the driver\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds seat of my 2003 oldsmobile alero, with the window fully down to get a good resolution.\n\nwhen we arrived home, we were talking about differing things and planning the evening activities, then i started looking at the images through the view screen on the camera. the first thing i noticed was an anomaly on an image alexander had taken last saturday morning as we passed through castle rock, co on i-25 southbound going to a soccer game in colorado springs. [this image was on the same memory stick and i am submitting a second report to you regarding this other incident after i complete this one.] \n\nwhen i zoomed up on the glowing form above a hot air balloon he had captured, i got excited and i told alexander he may have inadvertently photographed a ufo. then i decided to download all the images on the computer and look more closely at alexander\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds shot on the computer screen. when i did, i decided to print it out, along two blow-ups of the anomaly. \n\nas i prepared to do this, i took a quick look at the last two images i had photographed of the flatirons to see how they turned out. i was stunned to notice a glowing spot in the clouds on the second image. when i zoomed in on it, it appeared to be a pattern of four lights arranged in a circle or diamond pattern in the sky shining through the clouds. then i went about printing an 8\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd x 11 inch photo of this and the other image, and making two enlargements of both these anomalies. i made the enlargements with corel photo-paint 8 and digitally saved them as separate images. \n\nthis was all very exciting to me, as i have had many sightings in my 56 years of living, but never have had the blessing of capturing any of them with a camera. victoria and i had attended the recent mufon event in denver. we were moved by the documentary we saw of compiled evidence from a mexican journalist. victoria then saw two ufo\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds seemingly playing with one another in the sky off c-470 near lone tree, co, the next morning as she went to work. after that, i had prayed for an opportunity to get a photograph or video, but had no idea i was photographing any of them yesterday. and to discover while preparing this report today that i serendipitously photographed two separate ones within 15 minutes was wild!\n\nand unbelievably, the encounter was not yet over. while i was immersed in the profundity of having finally captured a ufo on camera and the delight of my son preceding me with his picture from last weekend, alexander noticed a red balloon we had placed behind the horn of a bison skull hanging on a wall of my living room last friday evening was beginning to shrivel. he also noticed the seven others in the room i had brought home for him from a celebration at the denver va medical center i had attended last thursday were just fine. so he pulled it down and examined it.\n\nafter a few moments, alexander told me there was a hand print somewhat smaller than his on the balloon. this was curious enough to get my attention, and we continued to examine it together. i have decided to detail this in another report to you immediately following this one. i was convinced that there was a strong possibility an alien entered my home tuesday evening and handled this object, leaving some remarkable impressions which i have documented with my digital camera and a video.\n\nindeed, at this point, i am ready to methodically document all my encounters with your organization and you will be hearing more from me. and i am reasonably certain i now possess an extremely valuable artifact providing evidence of an alien presence, so i hope to be in contact with one of your associated scientists in the near future for a scientific analysis of the balloon and the apparently heat or chemically-formed impressions on its surface where it was handled by some unknown life-form.\n\nsincerely, \n\nhenry c toney jr\nmail: pob 3733, boulder, co 80307-3733\nemail: inritoni@att.Net\nvoice: 720-404-6063\nfax:

and i (along with a few friends) sat on our back deck to await the long-anticipated event.  we were fortunate enough to live on the exact centerline of \u201ctotality.\u201d i had prepared a chart which showed the planets and stars that would become visible in different areas of the sky and suggested that everyone briefly turn their gaze to observe them.  but i also encouraged everyone to primarily focus on the sun as i knew the 2 minute-34 second window of opportunity would pass very quickly.  \nthe time approached, and i announced when the special eclipse glasses could be removed.  during totality, we were all mesmerized; suddenly taken by the absence of sound, we noted that birds could not be seen nor heard, and even insects had gone eerily quiet while basking in the mid-day  darkness.  an unexpected but very welcome stream of coolness seemed to spill over us on what was an ideally clear and otherwise hot summer afternoon.  \nin the final seconds of darkness, my husband asked why i had not taken a photo with my cell phone.  frankly, it had not occurred to me.  knowing there were only seconds to spare, i grabbed my cell phone and took a picture of the brilliant eclipsed sun.  however, i knew that a cell phone photo could not capture the spectacular and rare occurrence we were graced with witnessing that day.   \nseveral weeks later, i thought about the picture i had taken on that special afternoon.  i checked my cell phone and zoomed in on the sun.  as i remembered it from that day, the moon had overtaken the sun and had become engulfed with an angelic-like flowing translucence; but the photo could not compare with the memory of the actual event.  before closing the picture, i glanced above and below to see if any of the visible planets or stars could be seen.  much to my surprise, i found an object of enormous size (in my zoomed-in frame) in the 6:00 position below the sun.  it was clearly not one of the visible planets or stars (based on location).  and since it had been so quiet that day, i knew it could not have been an airplane.  \nbefore that moment, i had been a sceptic.  but coincidentally (if there are coincidences), around the same period of time, i watched a new netflix release: unacknowledged.  my skepticism turned to avid curiosity.  and since that day, i have been doing my research. i believe that what appeared on my photo during the great american solar eclipse might be evidence of something else: one of ours or one of theirs.  i would be most interested in your opinion.  thank you.\nattachment: below",

break from observing for a minute. i looked up at the sky (i believe i was considering what to point the telescope at next.) there seemed to be a black object moving against the background of stars. it was difficult to see, but it appeared to have a round outline. there seemed to be something like a crescent / semi-circular arc of cloudy white vapor near the forward edge of the object. the vapor was faintly illuminated. it was very difficult to judge size or distance to the object.\n  i think my first thought was that the object was a cloud, but it was moving too fast, moving against what little wind there was, and had too regular a shape. i assumed that if i kept watching it, i'd be able to figure out what it was.\n  it was moving too fast for me to train my telescope on it. (went from about 75 degrees above the horizon to about 15 degrees above the horizon in about 60 seconds.)\n  the object appeared black or possibly transparent. almost like a lens that was distorting the images of the stars behind it. \n  the object appeared to hold a steady course and speed towards the north-west, moving much like a jet aircraft as far as i could tell. i moved my position by about ten feet while watching it to try to get a clearer view (there was one small, leafless tree obscuring). \n  i lost sight of the object when a car drove through the neighborhood and the car headlights (pointed almost straight at me) made it very difficult to see anything else. after the car left, i was not longer able to see the object which had been nearing the point where it would have been obscured by nearby houses and trees in any case.\n  i saw a jet airliner a few moments later. the jet followed a path approximately perpendicular to that of the 'object' and about 35 degrees above the western horizon. i saw no indication that the jet was aware of the other object.\n the sight of the jet did give me a good reference for comparison. the object had seemed to move at approximately the same angular speed as the jet. if i assume that the object was moving at the same speed and at the same altitude (which i know is a lot to assume), then it would have been immense: a diameter at least 3 times the length of the 727 that passed through about 60 seconds later.\nthe sky was clear with excellent visibility. there were no clouds. the temperature was around 40 fahrenheit.\n  i would speculate that the object might have been some kind of stealth aircraft...Possibly a b2? it was very difficult to judge exact shape and size: basically i observed a black object against a black background. my impression was that the object was very large and basically circular, but i suppose it is possible that it could have been 'wing-shaped.' also, the object made no discernible sound (most air-traffic in this area is audible), and the \"crescent of white vapor\" at the leading edge was puzzling. also, there were no conventional aircraft lights of any kind on the object. we are only 20 miles from a major airport and 5 miles from a small airport. there is considerable air traffic at that hour of the night. it seems very odd that even a military aircraft would operate without running lights of any kind in this area. if the object was a b2, then it should have been close enough for engine noise to be easily discernible. i heard nothing.\n  after going into my house for a few minutes, i came back out to investigate several possible causes for what i saw (some kind of reflection? my own breath condensing somehow? some kind of spot light? a flock of birds somehow reflecting city lights? a drone? a blimp? a balloon?) none of these explanations seems to fit what i saw. it was too regular in outline for a flock of birds or a cloud. it was moving too fast for some of the other explanations, and it did not make any sound. also, a drone or other small object should have shown a much smaller angular size as it moved away from me. this object seemed to grow only slightly smaller as it moved towards the horizon, which would seem to indicate that it was at a considerable distance from me even when it was almost overhead.\n  i was calm both during and after the incident. even though it is st. patrick's day, i have not consumed any alcohol in over 24 hours. my major reaction was to think, \"i'm sure i can figure this out if i just think long enough.\" however, i have grown increasingly certain that no conventional explanation (that i can think of) completely fits what i observed. i wanted to post this while the memory is still fresh in my mind.\n  to me the identity of object remains unknown.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90837_submitter_file1__UnknownObject20180317.png"], "lat": "41.66879", "sighted_at": "2018-03-17"}, "90524": {"reported_at": "2018-03-03", "lon": "-85.64374", "summary": "I was standing at the kitchen sink approx. 10pm on 3-2-2018, looking out the window at the full moon shining bright. to look at the moon better i turned the kitchen light out and what looked to be a smaller white moon was below the actual moon,it was just through the tree top in the distance. at first i thought it was the moon reflecting off the window, so i ask my husband to come look at the moon and asked him if he saw the orb. he laughed and said it is just a reflection on the window, but i was skeptical. so i went and got my phone (samsung galaxy 5) to take a picture. i took a couple with the flash through the window, to atleast get a pic of the beautiful moon. the orb moved around back and forth in a slow circular movement, and changed from white to red at times. two of the pictures you can not see my tree and it was right there about 15ft away, the pictures have some weird white dots that look almost like i was looking at the moon while i was in space. the orb is captured in almost all of 18 pictures that i took. thinking that i would try to get a good picture of the moon, i went to the back of the house, behind the garage, outside so there wouldn't be any light interference. as i was taking (flash off) pictures of the moon, through my phone i could see a white orb, that would change to red, white, red. then i went back inside to look at my pics, they were quite strange. the ones that look like their from space, i zoomed out to see what was on them.  i saw what i thought looked like a ship of some sort and alot of smaller white dots, when you look closer, to me i see faces in the white spots and a white ship at the left of the moon. the picture shows some brighter white specks, in one section it looks to me like i am looking through space at a space civilization. it may be nothing but it may be something because i have never seen anything like this before. so i thought i would write you and send the pics to see what your experts think. the whole time i was taking the pics, it was calm outside with no sound and everything felt normal. the orb didn't make any sound, like i was watching from afar. in a couple of the pics the orb looks to have a aura around it.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90524_submitter_file1__20180302214326.jpg", "http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90524_submitter_file2__20180302213547.jpg", "http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90524_submitter_file3__20180302214647.jpg"], "lat": "42.44825", "sighted_at": "2018-03-02"}, "90831": {"reported_at": "2018-03-17", "lon": "-79.86931", "summary": "Did i just click a ufo ?

(i did what i could, but i used the video setting of my digital camera, and it came out very dark, and i don't have the technology to lighten it.)\n\nafter i returned, and tried to film it, it began to slowly move southward, down my street it seemed, and then curved to the southeast, out of my view.\n\nit frightened me when i first saw it.  really scared me.  it took awhile for me to realize i could capture it on film.  when i got my camera, i fumbled it around a lot.  i was shaken.\n\ni know it was not a plane.  two planes flew by later, following their normal east to west, or west to east paths that i see all day.\n\nthis object was very low in the sky.  probably less than 500 feet above the ground.  it was close enough that i should have heard some sound from an engine.\n\nit was also huge.  i can't say how big, but from one end of the strobing lights to the other, it was far bigger than any plane i've seen.  i'm even familiar with the sight of c-130's flying at night, having lived for two years at the marine military academy, right next door to the confederate air force, and an airport that allowed c-130's to practice touching down and lifting off.\n\nthis object had a solid row of strobing lights that moved in one direction.  i've seen no plane look like that before.  it was not a plane.  it was also not a helicopter.  \n\nthe only thing it could have been, besides being an unknown craft, is a blimp.  actually, come to think of it, it couldn't have been even that.  a blimp would have blocked out the sky above the lights, and that was not the case.\n\ni'll attach the films, perhaps you can clean them up.  the second film is the longest.  the strong row of lights you see are streetlamps.  please remember, i was very shaken when i took these, and it's a crappy digital camera recording.  thanks for all your diligent work in taking these reports.\n\n~~kevin", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/4010_submitter_file1__ufo_sketch1.jpg",

fighter jet flying around the lake havasu city area. after around 20 minutes i was able to spot it directly overhead at an altitude much higher than 30k feet. it was barely visible and i only spotted it for a few seconds, but it was definitely identifiable as a fighter jet. it appeared to be flying in a tight circle. i can\u2019t remember if it had a contrail or not. i lost track of it after just a few seconds, then heard it flying out of the area. after about a minute i heard it come back and again spotted it again flying in a circle and in just about the same spot. i lost track of it again after just a couple of seconds, and shortly afterward it left the area for good.\n\nhaving already seen two unusual incidents in this area in the past couple of months, i bought a canon vixia hf r800 camcorder with 32x optical zoom, which arrived just over a week ago. it\u2019s impossible to track objects on the display when they\u2019re high in the sky in broad daylight, so i just kind of pan the camcorder around the sky in the general area of what i see and hope for the best. the focus was set to infinite and the zoom was set to 32x optical (no digital).  hopefully i can improvise some sort of crosshair on it before long.\n\nafter the second sighting, i went inside and downloaded about 10 minutes of video to the pc and was able to catch something. this first video is of a white object. i don\u2019t know what it is. the perceived direction of flight is probably not the true direction or true speed because i was panning around slowly.  a few seconds into the video you see a commercial jet that was flying either to or away from la. i can\u2019t remember which. the clip between the white object and the jet is unedited. it will give you a real good indication of their relative sizes. for most of the day, i thought maybe the small white object was the afterburner of the fighter jet. later on, i realized that if it was afterburner, then the jet maybe should have been bigger in the film. either way, i don\u2019t know. i\u2019m not an expert. one thing i do remember, though, both times when i saw the jet i don\u2019t recall seeing any afterburner flame. i also know that when i twice observed the fighter jet it did not look anything like the white object in the video. it just looked like a fighter jet flying way up high in the sky. also attached is a screen print of the white object and the commercial jet side by side so you can compare relative observed sizes.\nlist of attachments:\nufo1 - short, real-time unedited video of the white object and a commercial

again, i am telling you this light was so huge and big it could not have been a flashlight, barn lamp, or car lights because it was 11:20 pm and all that was to the left of me was mostly farm land. i keep thinking it is still a helicopter spotlight so i keep looking around but can not see a thing in the sky. so at this point i am a little freaked out, i decide to try and call my boyfriend and the phone call would not go through, it would just say called failed without even ringing. i once again keep driving and saw the light once more, this light was not as bright as the first two times but still looked like a spotlight. by the way on the side where i kept seeing lights was mostly trees and farmland. i did not see anymore lights after that but did have a eerie feeling the rest of my

sighting. \ni have mapped out using google maps where we lived and where we saw our first sighting.\nit was my father, mother, brother and sister who witnessed this sighting and none of us knew what it was.\nbeing from that culture we had heard numerous ghost stories of the maritime area and we grew up with that mindset.\nthe object had 3 to 5 lights on it with changeing colours and blinking on and off. we knew it was not a plane, jet or helicopter and because of it being at least 100 feet over the ocean it could not be a ship.\nthe oject moved only slightly for at least one hour, to the point we were getting bored. it did leave and traveled s.E. over the water and went into the bay.\nwe had numerous sightings after that as well as the fishermen telling stories of what they saw numerous times while lobster and cod fishing as far out and 5 to 10 miles.\nim 66 years old now and all of the people and family members are gone. but that being said not one person ever took photos of any of their sightings.\ni just heard about a documentory that showed how the canadian government ask the american navy to help study these sightings in the 50 and 60s.\ni would be interested in learning more about what we saw.\ni live in las vegas now and in the 1970s we wittnessed ufo's in the skies are vegas but nothing ive seen in nevada was as close as these sightings.\nit is my theory that the reason for so much ufo sightings is our tides at the bay of fundy are the most extreme in the world. we have as much as 50 feet difference from low tide to high tide. as well at most of the

it was directly over me (a couple hundred feet at the most) i noticed two white lights to either side of it that weren't blinking, one red light on its front, and one white light on its back/bottom, and both the red and white light were alternating blinks. i could see the outline of it, and it was definitely a triangular shape. after researching a little the only thing i found is a tr-3b or a b-2. it's just very unusual timing, and we've never had anything like this fly over before. we've actually seen some larger fighter jets fly over during the day once or twice, but nothing like this.

pee.  i opened the sliding door that was off my bedroom and that lead to the backyard and the farm fields.  as i was waiting for bubba at the door i noticed how bright the moon was and how odd it was that there was 3 planes in the sky.  in that area air traffic is rare... so 3 planes at one time  was odd to me.  i remember watching the planes going in either direction and that's when i noticed lights flashing out the corner of my eyes.  i looked to my right to see this thing in the sky above the two apple trees in our back yard.  the flashing lights were in fact the band on lights that ran through the center of what appeared to be some sort of craft.  there was red and white lights moving round and round the center.  the craft appeared to be dark or black and like a disk with a bumped up middle. i was shocked and calling out for the dog, soon after what was there vanished right in front of my eyes.  it was there then gone in a flash.  i remember watching the trees and saw it how they moved with the wind and how in contrast this craft moved not at all.  it was silent and still.  i ended up getting the dog inside and shortly after a black helicopter and two silver planes flew above.  i went inside. it's taken me about to report this for a few reasons.  2017 was a very dark and sad year if loss for me.  since i have decided to do this the director of training, ryan stacey had been a great help and i am grateful.\ntwo weeks after this event i saw orange orbs in the farm fields behind the house. maybe about ten of them.  they dashed around the fields and in the trees but i didn't hang around long enough to see for how long.  i closed up the curtains and stayed inside.\non december 9th i had an experience with what i call the reptilian man, it was a 4 day fiasco of which i am sure. i woke paralyzed from the head down in my bedroom and yet could tell i was being moved on my bed.  i reluctantly turn my head from left to up and my eyes looked directly into the eyes of a snake man.  he was populating with me.  i couldn't speak and didn't want to even deal with it or it being a possible dream.  it was not hurting me but i am certain he or it wanted me to see the act.  there was no emotions and no expressions the act was militabt. it was an intrusive act and rape quite frankly that was not violent or unpleasant, i felt nothing. i told myself i would deal with it in the morning and what back to sleep.  when i woke in the morning i was freaking out.\nnow i want to know, why would it even have done that?  i am rh o neg and have two wombs... having children for me is nearly impossible not short of a miracle.  i thought reptiles didn't procreate for any other reason than breeding? since this all happened between nov and dec. my life changed.  i moved to niagara to care for my dying mother and since have left to western canada.  i worry now about many things.  i still am having issues with the idea that these beings can invade your home and head space and there is nothing we can do about it. now i wonder if the beings and ghosts and experiences i have had my entire life are related and worrying that the idea of abductions are now reality! maybe they were always a reality unknown to me?", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90764_submitter_file1__15497516101545422939269981340359641norig.jpg",

it on my computer and-paydirt! the photo was taken at the intersection of soliere and country club in flagstaff arizona, one mile from my apartment. shot was pointed about due west into the sunset, just after sunset. i did not see the object when photo was taken, only when reviewing them later on the computer (this, i heard, is common.). there is a low cinder cone volcano west of flagstaff, from my viewpoint, and the object was over the northern end of it (maybe a little past it at, i guess, around 10 miles.), obviously moving very fast. i cropped and enlarged the photo on adobe photoshop cs, got rid of the color data making it black and white, and then jacked up the contrast. when i did that, i noticed something very interesting. the \"tail\" on the object was a motion streak. since the shot was taken at 1/500'th second, a motion streak would indicate extreme speed. in the photo, the object was edge-on, and looked like a dark hockey puck with a lighter dome on top of it, not glowing. due to the extreme enlargement, the object is somewhat pixelated, but enough of it can be seen to tell the tale. camera data: used 5x optical-only zoom, 1/500'th second shutter, infinity focus, f4.5 f-stop, sony digital camera cyber-shot dsc-f717, hand held and available light, lens carl zeiss vario-sonnar, automatic exposure control, no filters. shot was taken at 5:53pm on 4october2005, phoenix

was. then it moved stright up, made a 90% turn an in less than a second fly out of sight.\n7. please note that i want no personal notice. my sales job must be one of quietness. i only want to know if
