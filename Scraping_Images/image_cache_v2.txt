just looked up at the sky. it seemed to still look like night with the moon shining very bright, giving off a green reflective light. at first, i thought it was a star because it was very bright. then it looked as if it was headed my direction so then i assumed it was a plane. my eyes were locked into the sky not really knowing what to comprehend. i lit up another cigarette, and just kept looking at the general direction the object was. the ufo was very far away in the sky, not entirely sure how far but up there in the sky. i found it unusual the object or ufo, whatever you call it, moved into the opposite direction it was headed initially, which was towards me. i knew instantly then was i was looking at but still was confused but i believe in extraterrestrials and would never believe that i had a chance to see this event happen in my life. i called my friend up and told him, we facetimed, and i was like \"bruh, i think i see a ufo, im pretty damn sure\" i changed the viewing from my face towards the object in the sky. i used the moon as another object as my point of reference. from his point of view, he saw the moon and another light as well. i'm pretty sure he couldn't be able to see as clear as i did. i told him i'll call him back and then around 6:23 am i started to take pictures, burst pictures, and videos of my iphone. towards the end i recorded a 15 minute video. i took a lot of photos and videos which clearly shows the object moving in different directions, left to right, right to left, towards me, away from me, going in circles, up and down. also when i was taking some pictures and videos, it somewhat distorted some parts of videos and pictures. also i zoomed in when recording and taking pictures but initially, recording was fine but than almost became static but then reverted back to normal. also the object seemed to disappear and then reappear. i could tell it was trying to hide or tried to camouflage, but i could still tell that the object was there because of its outline, even though it seemed not to appear there, it still had its outline. sometimes the became some sort of ball shape, changed its colors, disappeared and then reappeared. i never took my eyes of it and never stopped recording and taking pictures. towards the end, i thought it disappeared but appeared again and then finally disappeared. for the majority of the time, it was a bright light. also excuse my language in my video, i live in oakland, raised in the bay so my lango is different. also i showed me tenant when he came out to go to work, around that time it was getting light with which it was hard to see with the naked eye but through the camera i was still able to spot it. he also saw the object through my phone when i was recording. hopefully you can just mute some parts of me speaking.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90122_submitter_file1__IMG4153.MOV",

computer and-paydirt! the photo was taken at the intersection of soliere and country club in flagstaff arizona, one mile from my apartment. shot was pointed about due west into the sunset, just after sunset. i did not see the object when photo was taken, only when reviewing them later on the computer (this, i heard, is common.). there is a low cinder cone volcano west of flagstaff, from my viewpoint, and the object was over the northern end of it (maybe a little past it at, i guess, around 10 miles.), obviously moving very fast. i cropped and enlarged the photo on adobe photoshop cs, got rid of the color data making it black and white, and then jacked up the contrast. when i did that, i noticed something very interesting. the \"tail\" on the object was a motion streak. since the shot was taken at 1/500'th second, a motion streak would indicate extreme speed. in the photo, the object was edge-on, and looked like a dark hockey puck with a lighter dome on top of it, not glowing. due to the extreme enlargement, the object is somewhat pixelated, but enough of it can be seen to tell the tale. camera data: used 5x optical-only zoom, 1/500'th second shutter, infinity focus, f4.5 f-stop, sony digital camera cyber-shot dsc-f717, hand held and available light, lens carl zeiss vario-sonnar, automatic exposure control, no filters. shot was taken at 5:53pm on 4october2005, phoenix

ignored what she was saying to me and instead looked out the windshield at a slight angle towards the driver's side. in the sky, across from alvarez rd (in between rio grande,tx and roma, tx)i saw a bright white light, a perfect sphere.  my first reaction was: \"oh my god!! what's that!?..Oh my god..It's moving!!..It's f*king moving!\" while the driver still drove at 55mph-60mph, i kept track of the object for about 3seconds. the object was not far up in the sky, but instead it seemed to be pretty low to the ground. i saw it moving down towards the ground as if it were going to land. it moved downward in the shape of an arc, a movement i believe no airplane or helicopter do when they plan to land. anyhow, i do not know if the object landed because i lost site of it once it got too low to the ground because of trees covering the site. i noticed there was a house near where the object was, but there may be more than just one. the driver did not see what i saw, but i wanted to ask people around the area where i saw this object if they had seened something similar to my story but i was too scared of doing that for fear of being called crazy.  what made me first notice the object was its perfect sphere-shaped bright-white glow. when i first saw it, i didn't think anything of it; until i saw it was actually moving downward as if to land, i thought it could be perhaps a ufo because of the way it moved downward, forming an arc path. during the siting i felt in disbelieve; it was very unexpected because i was not looking at the sky to find strange things, but yet there it had been very tangible. while still on the phone with my mother, i told her what i had seen: the bright white light shaped as a sphere. after the sighting when i got home, i asked myself what it could have

its been a while.\n\none warm summer night around 10pm, with a clear sky and unlimited visability in lakewood washington, located approximately 3-4 miles nw of mcchord usaf base near tacoma i witnessed a very strange object close-up that also caused some physical reactions to myself and the surrounding yard where i was playing.\n\ni had planned to go bass fishing with my grandfather the next day and was practicing my casting in the back yard with my pool and a rubber weight.  the air had been extremely still, typical of summer nights in the region.  occassionally, depending on air traffic and winds, we were very close to the flight patterns for approach to mcchord air base and i always loved watching the c5's, b52's, phantoms and helicopters passing over the house at 1500-2000 feet on final.  normally they wouldn't pass over us at night because of sound constraints for the civilians but now and then they would.  i was very familar with all types of aircraft coming and going over the years both in daylight and night conditions. the sound of a c5 or b52 with full flaps on final at 1500ft can't be mistaken.\n\nthis event/sound was different.  as i stood in the back yard i heard a low multi-pitched hum i hadn't heard before.  knowing the flight line i looked to the northwest and waited for watever it was to come into view.  the property was fairly surrounded by fir trees of about 75 to 100' around the perimeter so i didn't have a line of sight to the horizon.  as the pitch grew closer & louder the surrounding trees started to sway but there was no wind.  then a triangular object appeared over the tree tops moving to the southeast toward mcchord usaf very slowly.\n\nthe object was at about 100-125 directly above me and barely cleared the trees.  it was triangular in shape with a large perhaps 25'diameter sphere in each corner which looked like glass glowing red to orange to yellow in a marble swirl patern.  the sound was very low frequency, perhaps less than 100hz with another at perhaps 500hz.  as it moved to the southeast it rotated clockwise slowly and made only a little over one rotation while in my sight for nearly 1.5 minutes in which time i'd guess it went 4-5 city blocks.  it took that long for it to move over the house and out of sight over the trees.\n\nthe superstructure between the spheres was a semi-dull metalic open framework with diagonal braces between two main stringers similar to a large metal structural building truss.  there was no platform of structure inside the perimeter of the framework and i could see thru the entire structure with the exception of the spheres in the corners.  it was nearly silent as it moved and the huming was at a level close to a moderate speaking level volume.\n\nas it flew over the trees moved violently without wind, my hair stood on end and i became light headed and a little sick to my stomack like motion sickness.  i also got a static shock from my fishing pole and i dropped it in the grass. once the object passed everthing went back to normal.\n\nthe object i estimated had three equal sides approximately 250-300' long or more. it just cleared the tree tops to the nw so i had a perfectly clear look at it.  the brightness of the spheres illuminated the super structure.  i asked my grandfather if he knew of anything like that and he felt initally that it was some sort of structure being carried by a large helicopter.  a hellicopter that large wouldn't have made a sound like that and i would have know it instantly.  anyone from the nam who has heard a huey comig for miles knows the sound and it was pretty large to by hung from a bell of a chopper.  this sound was an electronic hum and was nothing like an aircraft.  i never saw it again but its bothered me my entire life.  i just like things explained and with some level of credability and understanding.  it was a and remains a mistery to me but perhaps someone has a solution or explaination.", "photos":

the right side where i saw a very dark object in the horizon above the negev mountains. it was about 7pm and it was getting darker but i had a great view of this object even if it was at a distance. the object was like a black object, no wings, no lights whatsoever, following the vehicle at a distance for about 10 minutes flying slowly above the mountains range. i told my wife about this and she looked and saw it aswell. because of the hectic and long day/long trip, the other 10-15 passengers were all nearly asleep so i kept it for myself anyway. about 10 minutes into the sighting, the object suddenly stopped above a mountain range and just stayed there hovering above these particular mountains. as our vehicle was driving away, on this isolated and quiet road, towards our destination, i fixed the object for about 5 minutes who was still above that mountain range hovering until it disapeared from view. i believe that what i saw was a ufo. i know that 99% of sightings are expainable but this is no way this was a 'human' craft. it had no wings, was travelling slowly and just stopped there !What surprised me the most was that this object had no lights whatsoever...Usually ufo sightings are always connected with bright lights and so on....This was just a very black object with no lights whatsoever. i managed to take 1 picture with my digital camera which i hope you will find with this report. i showed the picture to a friend who's been in the ufo subject for many years and he's got reasons to believe that the object is a ufo travelling at a 45 degrees angle... i have also made some enlargements of the picture, as much as i could , maybe you could do better, but it seems we're looking at a ufo...On my return home in the uk, i did some investigation about my sighting and pulled a map of israel and it seems i might have had my sighting in the negev mountains, on the main road towards taba border, parralel to the ramon crater which is one of the biggest craters in the world. i am looking forward to hearing from you shortly with your views on this sighting and i am willing to help you with your investigations if you think it is worth doing one about

an aviation buff and lifelong sky watcher, i noticed a white/silver metallic sphere moving at a high rate of speed tracking roughly south to north at an estimated 10-15,000 above ground level. there was no exhaust or visible means of propulsion in a standard sense. while holding my dog\u2019s leash i grabbed my mobile phone out of my pocket to attempt to record some video before the sphere would be lost in my line of sight over the tree line. the video is terrible since i was juggling the dog leash and fighting with the sun glare on my phone. there are only a few frames of the object. i have seen the same type of sphere moving at a fast speed a few years before, ironically, while walking my dog at the park. it is only because of the following activities that i was prompted to get this event documented.\n\nafter losing sight of the object i continued around the trail wondering whether what i witnessed was advanced human technology or something otherworldly. minutes later at approximately 12:07 while walking southbound on the western side of the greenbelt, i heard a low hum and looked left and up. at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet i saw what i\u2019m convinced was an air force c-17 globemaster, a huge four engine cargo jet. in nearly four years of living in central texas, i\u2019ve never seen one before. it was tracking the same south to north direction of the flying metallic sphere, but approximately two miles east. i could only wonder if the c-17 was tracking the sphere, or it had released the sphere itself in some military test, or if seeing the two in the space of 7 minutes was coincidental.\n\ntwo days later, on sunday march 18, 2018, i was, again, walking my dog around the park. while walking northbound on the east side of the park i began to hear a low rumble and recognized the sound of military helicopters. only occasionally do you see any military choppers over cedar park, even given that the us army base fort hood is only 45 air miles away north northeast. i stopped and looked around for the choppers. this was 11:22 a.M. central. what i believe were two apache attack choppers were about one-half mile south from location and traveling west at approximately 3,000 feet above ground level. they were flying close together with the lead chopper staggered to the left of the other. what happened next made my jaw dropped the lead chopper abruptly jerked the chopper right (north) over roughly the same track the metallic sphere had been flying two days earlier. the lead chopper\u2019s move must have come to a surprise to the back chopper, because there was nearly a mid-air collision. the two choppers continued that course until i lost sight of them because of the tree line. just as i was getting to my car to load my dog and head home, i heard another low hum at 11:32 a.M. flying the same course west as the other two choppers was a lone apache. and it made the same move (but smoother) of heading north along the track of the other choppers and the metallic sphere two days earlier.\n\ni have no idea as to what these events mean. i can only chalk them up to high strangeness at this time.", "photos":

i was speaking with her about some of the specific details i found some sense & reason with, there was a sudden silence, then, i paused (feeling something unsettleing), then, something fell into the

collaborating witnesses, who don't realize what exactally they've been near...Sorry to be so vague...Don't want to write too much without knowing who's on the recieving end).\n  after hearing something \"fall\" into the sink, i said something (to anything that might be in there), waited (was actually pretty scared, my adrenaline was definately flowing), after about 30 - 45 seconds, we heard a whirling kind of sound (difficult to describe) that neither of us had ever heard before, but thjere was no doubt what that sound was (this apartment building was about 1/2 block long, the sound cam from the side where the bbq's are...There's nowhere close by that could've justified this sound...Too far from street).\ni then phoned the local police (which, by the way, was right across the street...Maybe 150-200 yards away).\ni requested a unit to do a quick drive through the alley & surrounding area of the building. when asked to state what i thought the sound came from, i replied that i'd rather not state an opinion, but that i knew what it was...The officer did not sound surprised or even curious for some reason (it struck me as rather odd, seen as how this city would not be the kind of place where anyone would expect for something like this to take place...You'd have to know glendale, i guess).\n\nthere is, of curse, some significance (i believe) with other times i've witnessed/experienced/noticed.\n\n**somewhat related...I'm attaching a digital sketch (or painting) i did freehand, from scratch in the program \"corel painter ix\" about 6 months ago. although, i never saw a being during the event described above, this is aomeone/aomething i had encountered for 5 or 6 consecutive nights in 2001 (approx. 20 sec. ea.), then once more early morning, a few months later.\n\ni have reason to believe that there are some important details i may have, to somehow help, inform (or something...).\n\n**side note - i am a two time emmy award winning animator, not some bored paranoid freak (i may be a freak, but that's just me...Lol).\n\nif someone can contact me, i'd apreciate it.\nthank you,\n-jm", "photos":

two planes but a third object ahead of them darker and smaller didn't seem to be a third plane. trees and horizon blocked my sight as they flew over to the north. came back inside and starting looking to magnify the photos and noticed the dark object they were following in the photos to blurry for me to really see anything marking or even basic shape. i showed these photos to family they weren't to sure what the third object was either.\n\n for years the a-10s have had training flights right over my house every at least once or twice a year, this was the first i've seen this year. there has always seemed to be just two a-10s that i've seen flying in formation using the farms and silos as targets, they usually branch out over both roads after crossing over my house. the sounds just seemed different this time to me. if needed i will search for the past photos of a-10s flying over head.\n\nthis time you can see in the photos they are both heading the same way after a dark object. one planes appears to be changing course to follow object. i hope the photos can be of help because it just looks to blurry for me and therefore less credible. i have the white photo but didn't attach for

"My wife and i were traveling south on trooper road (route 363) towards the intersection at egypt road in our personal automobile for a late supper, as i had just returned home from work.\n\ni spotted a bright orange orb relatively high in the sky traveling slowly in a horizontal straight line in a se direction, making its way over the home depot and walmart in audubon. i'd say the orb was at least 4 or 5 times brighter that the planet venus when venus is at its brightest.\n\ni pulled out my iphone while i was driving and attempted to video the orb in the sky. i did this twice, but apparently was unsuccessful, as i was trying to do this while i was driving in traffic. i had it on the screen of my iphone for at least 10 seconds at one point, but perhaps i didn't engage the video button on the screen, as i was continuously looking back and forth between the object and the car in front of me.\n\nthe orb then just faded from view while over the industrial park just south of the shopping center. it didn't go into clouds, and didn't speed away - the luminosity just turned off while the object was in place in the sky over the industrial park.\n\nwhile our car was approaching the intersection at egypt road, a white light, slightly smaller than a golf ball, appeared out of nowhere and headed straight for our car, traveling about 4 feet above the payment until it was about 10 feet in front of the vehicle, then it shot straight up into the sky. i thought it might have been a large insect, but frankly i believe it was too cold that night for insects to be flying around, and the movement of the object was too fast and the path too straight. i'd estimate the entire duration of this sighting to be all of about a second.\n\nthe orange orb was still up in the sky and remained there while this other stuff was going on. i'd say the orb was visible in the sky for at least 5 minutes.\n\nwhen i got to the restaurant, i was disappointed to see that the video i thought i had taken of the orb was non-existent. what i did have however, was 1.2 seconds of video that i did not even remember taking. it showed two small white lights moving fast and erratically.\n\ni enhanced the video from the original, and ultimately slowed it down to the point where i'm thinking the lights may have been birds - but i'll let you be the judge of that. i included the original video, plus two versions that i digitally enhanced in an effort to better see what was going on.\n\nanyway, when you look at the videos, notice the white light to the right of the street lamp in the right-center of the frame. then there's a second white light streaking across the frame  that stops right above that same street light when the video ends.\n\nbut for me, the real mystery remains the bright orange orb in the sky, and even after posting about the experience on social networking, i've not found anyone else who has seen it - other than my wife. frankly, with all of the cars out on the road and with the busy parking lots at the shopping centers, i don't know how anybody could miss it.\n\ni was intrigued enough with the sighting the following day to consider calling the lower providence police to see if anyone called in the sighting, but i finally decided i didn't want to put myself through that. so i decided to file a report with you guys.\n\njust so that you know my orientation - i'm 63 years old and never experienced a ufo sighting until march 23. and i do not believe that ufos are of extraterrestrial origin. i'm sure there is a terrestrial explanation for this, and i'm just curious as to what it may be.\n\none more thing:  last summer i saw a series of similar objects hovering in a cluster slightly north of last friday's sighting, also on trooper road. while the sighting was initially startling, i finally figured out that they were probably illuminated lanterns with the air inside them heated by a candle that somebody in the adjoining neighborhood released all at once.\n\nthe object my wife and i saw on friday was not a lantern. it was higher in the sky, and looked more like a flare - like the kind used in the maritime industry for search and rescue. but there was no tail on this object. and it moved slowly and horizontally in a se direction until it extinguished.", "photos":

photo of the actual rock in the distance. as i framed up the photo i thought. you may not be able to recognize the rock in the distance. i take the photo, immediately select it and enlarge it to see if you can recognize the eagle rock in the background. as i enlarged it i see this spec and was startled. still standing in the spot, mere seconds later i look up and there is nothing there. i never actually saw it, only in the picture. there was no helicopter, blimp, drone, jet or any noise. if it had been any one of those things it would have still been there. it was strange enough that i felt compelled to put it right into social media.  people said blimp, etc. some said a dirty lens. i knew enough about cameras that if it was a spec on my lens that it wouldn\u2019t look like this. it would be blurry and not hard edges, and pixelating when enlarged. i even did an experiment later that day. i put a rather large piece of black pepper in the center of my lens and took a pic of the sky. i was correct, it was so blurry that the camera basically focuses around it and it become a large darker portion of the sky eliminating the spec on my lens theory. i\u2019ll include this experiment photo with my 3 attachments, two photos and one video.\n        here is where it gets good. later that night i was flipping through my iphone photos. it\u2019s a relatively new phone to me and i noticed some time ago after getting this phone that when i flip through my still photos there is a split second of video attached. about 1/2 to 1 second. i have now idea why or for what purpose, but it does. anyway, i flipped on the the picture in question and i didn\u2019t see the spec! and then there it was. i flipped back and forth and realized that i caught a split second of video of this object and it is covering a ton of ground in the tiny moment! it comes from the far right side of my lens to where it rests in the photo in that split second. that\u2019s when i knew i had something i strange and felt compelled to file this report.\n\ni\u2019ll attach 3 things.\n1) the photo with the object in the center frame above the eagle rock. it\u2019s above and slightly to the left of the

parent who also saw it. it was close enough that i saw people outlined in the windows. it actually appeared to be no more than 2-300 feet up. we were sure that it was crashing. later a guy i went to

"summary": "Ok let's begin. we were visiting a friend of ours that lived in the apartments next to where the ufo encounter started for us. we visited for awhile and then our friend went to bed. at that time it was really late, way after 2am. we were both into astronomy and so we decided to sit on the ground next to the apartment(west side of building) and stargaze. we were looking at the stars and admiring the beauty of it all. and it's important to note that from our vantage point we were looking in the eastern sky. after about two hours we were looking up i noticed a white star that seemed a little unusual. it was bigger than all the rest of the stars and there was something about it that didn't seem right and it got my attention. i told my friend to look at the unusual star and so we both starred at it. the star was up about 40 to 45 degrees from the horizon. we were starring and watching this unusual white star for at least 30 minutes. as we were watching this unusually bright star, the rays of the star began to get bigger and bigger. which we both looked at each other in amazement and astonishment. the rays of what appeared to be a bright white star began to almost come directly at us or it appeared that way. as this was going on the wind began to pick up and we heard some rustling in the tall dead grass next to us. we both got a little frightened after that since the rays of the star was unusual enough. we both proceeded to get up from sitting on the ground and try and see if our friend that lived in the apartment was still awake or not. we were going to tell him about the unusually bright star. we couldn't get anyone to answer the door that early in the morning. we then proceeded to go knock on another person's door that he knew that was directly across from the other apartment we were just at. at this point a few hours had passed. as he was opening up the metal screen door to his other friends apartment i was behind him. something caught my attention and we then both turned around looking up and witnessed a large object coming out of the sky. we both were in amazement. we walked out away from the apartment and slightly towards whatever was coming out of the sky. then all i can remember is that there was this blackish grey triangular craft gliding over the top of us. time seemed to slow down at this point. as it was going over us i got a good look at it. it had one small red light directly in the middle of the craft. it had three slightly larger white lights on each corner of the craft. i also noticed that there was multicolored lights moving in between the white lights. like in a pulsating pattern. i remember as the craft was floating over us we both were saying, \"wow\" in total amazement and astonishment. i remember feeling that there was this low humming vibration going through my body and concentrating in my chest.(later on my friend confirms this as well)there was a really low sound but this may have been this low humming sound/vibration. as it floated over us i remember watching it float/glide away from us and again it seemed like an eternity as we both watched it float away. i remember feeling sad that it was going away. we then watched it float up and over these nearby houses. it was moving very slow. in my mind i was thinking that it almost looked unreal at how it was floating and moving up and over the houses.\nwe then frantically went back to his car(chevell) and got in. we just sat there with our jaws open and not saying a word, except for \"did you see that\". as we were pondering in disbelief as to what just occurred we both started to feel as though we were telepathically communicating with each other. this was shocking and scary to us. we almost couldn't look at each other. he then said that he just saw some symbols on my forehead. which was really strange to me. and if the ufo encounter wasn't strange enough. we sat there in his car for a long time trying to take all of the experience in. we were both still in a state of shock. we both agreed that we wouldn't say anything to each other about what we just experienced and that we both would draw on a piece of paper what we saw when he dropped me off at my house. at this point i remember as we were sitting in his car that a trash truck was coming up to the apartments and began to take the trash. we both thought this was unusual and we were thinking why a trash truck would be working this early in the morning. so at this point the time had to have been in the early hours before the sun was to come up. he then proceeded to take me to my house and drop me off. there wasn't alot of talking between us as we were still trying to process what had happened to us. when we pulled up in the front of my house we both agreed to draw what we had witnessed. he got out a piece of small paper which i think it was a receipt and he ripped it in half. he gave me a pencil and we both began to draw what we had seen. we then looked at each other's drawing and it was an exact match. a triangle craft with one light in the middle and three on each corner.\nwe just sat there in disbelief. we said our good byes and i went into my house to go to bed since it was getting light out. \nso that's the main part of the ufo encounter me and my friend had. \nnow on to the rest...\nthe next afternoon we contacted each other on the phone and as we were discussing the incident some very unusual memories began to emerge. for one we both remember seeing the highway and a bunch of red tail lights going north on the highway. there was a bunch of emergency vehicles going north on 55hwy. and the memory is up in the air somehow looking down and north towards the highway. also the tail lights seemed blurred or elongated. but was definitely a birds eye view of the highway going north. the strange thing is is that from where we were at at the time of the encounter there's no way physically possible to see the highway. this is very strange to me. \nanother strange thing is that about a week later i was working as a janitor at a school mopping the floors when all of a sudden this thought of a blueprint of some sort came into my mind. i don't remember what it was or meant but i talked to my friend at the time about it and he said the same thing happened to him. so that's a mystery as to whether it was related to our encounter. and we weren't sure whether we was abducted but we may have been. that would account for seeing the tail lights go down the highway.\n\none final note i want to add is that my friend said that after he dropped me off he went into the 711 right up the road from the apartments and there was emergency personnel in the gas station talking about something. i'm assuming they got word of the incident from it being reported or saw the craft as well. \n\ni'm also willing to take a polygraph test if necessary.", "photos":

"1. i was with my 13 year old son, alexander, coming from subway at the baseline shopping center, going to the bus stop in front of the department of commerce on broadway, in south boulder. i was looking west toward the flatirons and saw this dark object that looked like a boomerang floating above and behind the buildings and in front of the foothills. \n2. i noticed the object because it was fairly large and dark in a sky with grey clouds above the object holding just enough light from the setting sun to create distinct contrast.\n3. at first i thought of a flock of geese because of the wedge formation they often take, but this made no sense rather quickly because of the mass of the structure.\n4. the object was a lot like a boomerang. it was very dark in appearance and displayed no lights. the two \"wings,\" which were equal in length and converging at close to a right angle, formed a pointed end or you could say they radiated from a pointed front. the ratio of the width of the \"wings,\" relative to their overall length was approximately 1:6. the object seemed to be floating, and this sense was enhanced by a rotation of the object as it moved south, curiously almost as if a boomerang whirling in slow motion. yet before our bus arrived, it lingered in one spot for several minutes, although there was a breeze at ground level, so it appeared to have its own power, displaying hovering and rotation and variable speeds. i would estimate its size as rather large, perhaps having \"wings\" of 100 feet in length. i say this because i got some sense of how high it was - around 1,000 feet - as it moved in front of and near the flatirons. also, a small plane flew over it from the southeast going northwest into the mountains just before our bus arrived while the object was hovering in one place. \n5. when i realized i was looking at a solid object and not a flock of geese, i said to my son, \"what do you think that is, ander,\" and pointed it out to him. then it began rotating and we just watched in amazement as it floated south. ander (alexander) noted right away that it had no lights. i attempted to take photographs of it, but it was too dark for it to appear in the digital images. nonetheless, the camera did reveal some closer objects in the night sky, light up by the flash. and i took one mpeg clip, but i don't know if i captured the object. also, i believe it is possible that the object began hovering in one place as a response to my camera flashes. i was excited about the event because i experienced a ufo sighting with my son.\n6. the sky kept getting darker and our bus arrived, so it was very hard to see as we left, but still hovering.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/4813_submitter_file1__DSC05536.JPG",

i had fell asleep to in my living room. i got up to let my two dogs out in the backyard which is paralell with interstate 20 in weatherford tx, as i approached the backyard at around this time of night it is almost pitch black outside because of nearby bussiness's that turn off their lights completely to save money i'm geussing.. almost every light except for a few in every mile is off around this time including the big advertising signs that are across the street from my house so the night sky is very beautiful at this time, being able to see constellations very clearly. well right before i was going to open my sliding door to let my dogs out i had noticed two strange pulsating lights traveling towards me, because as i stared at them i was in awe and also trying to figure out if they were just airplanes or maybe choppers but then i noticed that these objects had pulsating lights that seem to have changed colors from a white to a orange then from orange to a red and from red to gold it was pulsating but strangely turning colors at a very slow rate like nothing i have seen before, so as i was in awe just watching them i saw the object to the left started to change direction in a zig zagging pattern and all of a sudden it went from being close range to the other object to almost immediately traveling a great distance to the west and descending as it traveled then it just hovered and slowley traveled west and then came to a stop and hovered at a distance while the other object was traveling toward my house as i focused my attention on the closer object it started to take shape because of how close it was getting. again i was in complete awe so i just stood there watching this object pulsate the same kind of lights as the other one and was zig zagging at slow rate till it got closer then again this object came to a complete stop and hovered about 40 degrees from my sight i could tell it completely stopped because it was on the the other side of a electrical poll in my backyard so i could tell if it was moving or not about a couple minutes of just standing there watching i started to notice almost like a faint beam come down from the bottom of the top shape object and about four or five white orbs started coming out of the bottom of this object at that point i was getting kind of freaked out because i have never seen anything like this before in my life. i was in the marine corps and had seen my fair share of aircraft,flares and explosives etc.. so as this was happening i ran in the house from my porch and got my phone to try to capture what was happening i was only gone for about a minute, but when i returned i could only see both of the bigger objects but none of the orbs that had dispersed. so before these were gone i wanted to get some pictures on my phone. unfortunately i thought my camera and video camera would have caught a decient picture or video but it just was not suffient enough to get good details or shapes just little dots in the sky if i tried to take a good photo but i will still include them below. besides the camera i actually had gone outside and was able to continue to observe these objects at a hover in the sky for the next 15 minutes or so before disappearing completely from view. after this first sighting i saw only one object within the next week or so in the same part of the sky with the same lights and shape but in different directions and altitude.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90223_submitter_file1__20180129024636.mp4",

the south, southeast at a very high rate of speed while the others continued east at an increased rate of speed.  the whole time the lights were brilliantly bright, just unreal bright from all angles that we saw them from and continued to flash in a random manner, not together and with no noticeable pattern.  the flashing of the lights was really fast between the different colors and the only reason i am able to describe 3 different colors is that i could make out white and orange, my daughter saw goldish yellow and my wife saw reddish orange. we finally lost sight of the objects as they flew behind the tree line.  we were super excited upon seeing this because you hear stories and read things but never get to actually see it.  every photo i tried to get, once i noticed them turned out like garbage and they didn't even show up; however, the 2 photos that i took before i noticed the lights did capture the objects (they look small and far away because of the crappy phone camera, like when trying to take a picture of the moon and then that looks tiny on camera).  the photos that i have show the lights when they were in their initial diamond shaped flight pattern.  i'm attaching the photos and i haven't monkeyed with them, didn't even want to circle them or rotate the picture because i don't want anybody saying they're faked.  the pictures show the lights on the inside of the rainbow and the lights are bright white but small.  still really excited about the whole thing.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/72588_submitter_file1__image1.jpg",

we notice what looks like lights on a radio tower only they are different, brighter, and appeared to be moving at the same rate we were along the roadside above the tree line at about 300 feet. i asked peter if he sees what i see and he too confirmed that it was really happening before our eyes. there were 3 vertical white/amberish lights with a weird cloud like fog or glow below them. they are moving a bit faster than we are at about 35 m.P.H. or so until we come to a stoplight. the 3 lights begin to morph or compress into 2 lights then 1 light, still with this weird foggy glow below them. the glow was constant until the 3 lights became 1 light then the glow surrounded the light & faded away. the center light became very small and looked exactly like a star and it stopped moving. we commented on how clever this seemed because it truly modelled itself to blend right in with the other stars in the sky. we kept our eyes on it, exhilarated at what we both were witnessing together. just then a much bigger glow appeared around the star and a much bigger elliptical 45degree angle glow also faded into view, it was huge, it took up our entire field of view through the front windshield. the glows all appeared to me like an aurora borealis kind of plasma energy, it took on a slightly bluish tint. our light signal turns green and we turn left heading east on sumpter rd..Then the star became much brighter and began to expand and split just like a cell does when it grows under a microscope. it split into two symmetrical distinct balls of light with these outer ring glows, we were really getting excited about what we are witnessing and i pull the car over to get a better look, just as we slow to a stop, the glows and lights expand at the same rate a firework display does, only it stays perfectly symmetrical in it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds expansion. we can see streaks inside of the plasma ball glow, that squiggle and move a bit like electricity. we are both gasping and our expressions are pretty hilarious as we are oh, my god\ufffd\ufffd\ufffding and , what the #@!% is that. then the entire formation imploded or shrank an a fraction of a second and simply vanished!\nno trace after 1/2 second. it simply vanished. we both had goosebumps from head to toe and were astonished at how big this was for us, and how long event took right near a busy intersection prime time on a friday night. many cars were around us and driving, i choose to know if they were looking up and saw it. surely as big as this was somebody else must have seen it too.  this is an experience that confirmed for me what i felt in my heart. we are being visited by other worldly energies, and or craft. no scientific explanation can begin to explain what this was. whatever it was... it truly was in and then out of this world, in less than a second!\n\nwe called people we knew from the school and heard that many of the students and families leaving the event also witnessed the event, and they told us the consensus was it was the space shuttle. to which we thought was ridiculous, but hey as bizzare and life altering this was for me, i can imagine that people would try to rationalize and justify such an amazing phenomena.\n\ni am a graphic designer and immediately came home with my friend peter and recreated in photoshop exactly what we saw and the timings it happened in so we would verify and validatebetween the two of us the accuracy of our event. we showed it to our family and a few friends, and then put it aside. i felt it was time to share it. i recently edited the images into a video sequence so the effect could be witnessed in realtime the way we saw it.", "photos":

the event happens everynight. i was watching a movie downstairs in my basement and went to smoke a cig. i am a person who has also been interested in astronomy my entire life and am fascinated in the stars. as i gazed into the night sky, i noticed an unusually bright star in the sky. the star had a bright faintly blue band across it and a faintly visible, transparent halo around it. figuring it to be mars at first because i know that mars was the most visible planet in the sky at that time, i stared in wonder. then it came to me that mars appears almost dark orange. this was bright yellow with a faintly orange tint, and last i checked, doesn't have a band across it. so i started assuming saturn because jupiters ring isn't visible with the naked eye. then it wobbled and slightly dropped. stars nor planets descend in the night sky and wobble. i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and rubbed them and began to look again. then when i compared it to the moon, it was lower. this thing was in the air. i refused to believe what i thought i was thinking so lit another cig and continued to observe. i noticed it was drifting and then it appeared to start a direct, very slow, almost unnoticable decent towards me and stop. \n\ni must say this.I am a former us marine. my mos was avionics technician f-18's. i have seen many different types of aircraft both military and civilian and none of them hover anything like this, and none are dead silent. they also have multiple lights that flash in an arranged pattern. this thing was bright, one solid color, silent, and the band i saw at first, is not a band. its extremities, but not wings. it also began to appear as either 2 seperate balls on top of each other joined by this blue colored now v shaped joint is the best way to describe it, or a longer type object. it was hard to distinguish because it would change slightly when it drifted to a slightly different position. it appeared to move in a manner to try to remain unnoticable, but i could tell. i went inside and grabbed my moms cell phone camera and went back outside and was suprised to see it there still, though it had shifted to a slightly different position but same general location. i struggled to snap off 2 different shots as it was very difficult to get it on the tiny little display, and i'm still not sure if i got it or not. after about an hour, i started second guessing myself and walked inside shaking my head almost laughing at myself that i even thought i saw what i think i saw. was i going crazy???\nyeah, i must have been tired and my mind was playing tricks on me. after all, don't ufo's move really fast at odd flight patterns and only last a few seconds at best. they're also supposed to have lights and zip around and do neat little tricks. they also don\"t start backing up when you aim a camera at it!!What do they care if you snap a few shots.\n\nthe next night, same day, i ate dinner and went outside again to smoke. i looked up to the same spot i had witnessed it the night before and of course i saw nothing. i began to laugh at myself at what i saw the night before. in geberal curiosity i thought, what the hell. i'll walk around my house while i smoke and just see. as i walked i a glimpse of a light the same color and brightness that i had seen the night before peering through a small gap in the top of the tree line to my left. it was dusk and still a little light remained. again as it had been that morning the sky was crystal clear. i moved further up my driveway thinking to myself that there was no possible way that i was seeing that thing again. i got to the front of my house and plain as day their it was, craddled between the bowl shaped gap in the tree line. now, i had a reference field to all but the top side and it sat directly in the center. it didn't take nearly as long to see it move this time as it had before. it was going left and right, up and down in a wobblly manner. i ran inside and got my parent to come out and see. sure enough, they both saw it. it wasn't making large movements, but very noticable comparing to the trees around it. then it moved up over the tree line and slightly left out of the clearing and continued to hover. it was at about a 45 degree angle and i assumed it to be about 20000 feet or so due to its size. i ran inside and grabbed the digital camera this time and my binoculars. i started to aim, but again had trouble getting it to show up on the display. so i just started to point and took a couple of guess shots. by this time it was dark, and stars had started to appear. i went in and downloaded this first batch to my comp. i was absolutly amazed at what came out. the picture resembled nothing like what i saw. the image was red and moving around very rapidly. you can tell because it resembled a still traffic shot. i thought that may have been the slight movement of my hand, but in a few of the other shots, there are 2 stars in the background, 1 blue, 1 green. i went back out and watched in disbelief and awe as i took a few more shots over the past hour and a half. again, it never left. i had called the nuforc and left a message and emailed them the pics.\n\nthe next day, i got call from them. this was a monday. the so called scientist that spoke to me insisted it was mars and hadn't even looked at my pictures. he had a bad attitude and completly blew me off belittling me the entire time. i wanted to say something really bad but he hung up before i could retort.\n\nok. thats the beginning of a very long story that grows day by day for almost a month now, non stop, every night, all night. from sun down till i don't know how long, assuming sun up. brief summery of things since.As i have taken more pics (over 200) and watched, now i have a telescope, i have been able to detect many other things going on. theres more than 1 in the sky. there is a peremeter. they post in different positions and no matter where i go on my property, which is about 2 acres that is very open then extends into a fence of thin woods, neighborhoods around at a distance, a dark sky, and road that brdges 2 kinda busy roads about 5 miles from the interstate that gets dead at night. in some of the pics, you can see orbs as well as the objects being photographed. you can tell they are 3-d and have indentions. i discovered them by mistake as they are invisible (or were to me until now) when i looked at one of the pics i took by mistake when i couldn't get the camera to flash and began to point it at a differnt spot and it went off. this pics is one of my favorites. they look like the diagrams of cells you see in biology books and it even appears that they are splitting! there tons of them and they where all around me!! i had no clue. i can see them now, but they appear as just circles in which the area i see them is slightly fainter and distorted compared to the rest of the sky. i see many shadows that buzz past and flashes that shot by. i have pictures of this too. sometimes i can see what looks like a tiny diamond that sparkles very sharply just in the air no more than 10 feet away and at sternum level with me. whenever i stare at that and take my focus off the surrounding area, i can see a figure that looks like the shape of a small human. this is not like the typical description of the greys that i have heard so much about. they are about 4 feet tall, some shorter than others, and they will not approach me. if i get closer than a few steps towards it, it vanishes like it just fades into the area behind it like a chammeleons blends in with the color of its surroundings, but when i step back, reappears. these are very real beings that have the technology or ability to do this, like camoflouge. there heads are properly proportioned to there bodies, and there eyes are black, but not as slit as they are oval and on towards the top of there head, like a bug almost, but human. also the very top of there eyes appear slightly reflect light like a pair of sunglasses has that tiny bright spot where the sun reflects off. they observe every move i make and are everywhere i am at night, and can point them out to anybody, at least the crafts that i think are more or less personal transport units.They have no facial features other than eyes and almost look like kermit the frog in the face. i have a picture of this as well that i took inside my house looking out because the first time i thought i trully saw it it looked liked something was peering through my window, and more than one. i had very mixed emotions about the pic because i tried to regard the images i saw as reflections of like out the window. but i showed it to several people and my best friends who lived with me for a week and saw almost everything i saw, and still can like me, though he is in the mountains, have concluded that the images are real. this was primarily based on comparing the shots we took in my jeep when we got some daylight pics in the subdivision down by my house. when we left we got on the interstate and took some shots while in motion and window up in a few and only got 1 flash with no images of kermit looking creatures peering back. i must correct myself. in the picture with the image, there are 2. one right at my window peering from through the bottom, with a reflective flash off its peeering eyes, and another image in the back to the right that had very serious eyes that were slightly more slanted and slit and looked more like it was watching the other figure like a boss observes his subordinate.\n\nthere ones in the woods that look exactly like the watcher one in the air as i first decribed from day 1, but they seem to have a different task. they analyze, everything. study everything around them to the last detail with what looks just like a double lens laser pointer that emits either 1 or 2 either red or white dots on whatever it is looking at, including you! i have watched them before and seen the dots appear on me. they stay back and do their own thing, almost always in the same spot just floating slightly around. i have now noticed in the past 2 days a different one. this character at first looked like a a small cloud with whitish yellow sparkles. when i got a good look at it with binoculars in tree line gaps, i can tell it has a definite shape, like a human wearing buffy clothes, and the sparkles dont sparkle but are a constants glow placed in very specific places and when they appear to move very wildly about it, that it it moving that part of it body. he seems to be top dog because he points his little beams at the other guys and they react. also, when i stare at him for more than a few seconds with binoculars, those little dots start appearing on me. i also feel things start to get all around me and get what feels like a forced sense of overwhelming paranoia. thats when i also see the figures that i mentioned earlier that at first look like floating diamonds. i need to get a picture of him, need a new chip for digital camera cuz my other one is loaded up. they really got pissed when i pointed my telescope at him. i decided that might not be a good idea, and took it back in until i can asses that a little better.\n\ni at first wanted to remain unanimous, but after emailing coast to coast, and oops, the cia, about this matter, in which that was a while back and far less detailed, and no response from anybody, i want to get into this field and research the hell out of it.Especially because since i informed the cia, you can't go more than 1 second without seeing either an f-18, i know them from the bottom and light patterns because i worked on them, recon plane with its spotter lights for taking nighttime aerial photos, a helocopter or some other military aircrafts like those used by the fbi or dea to watch people from above, and most of the time they fly at very low altitudes and very slowly over my house.\n\nthis is not a joke. i would like from somebody to please at least look at these pics. you can send an investigator out to my house if you wish any night you choose and you will see i'm very serious about this. i have nowhere else to turn. i had given up actually until i saw your web sight. i have been thing very extensivly about creating an organizations that follows up on these kind of reports that everybody, including so called ufoologist such as the one that didn't even give me the time of day despite the fact i have many pictures, yet goes off claims in which no evidence other than a single persons testimony is provided. that just blows my mind and makes me think no wonder why we can't publically prove life exists outside this planet.I have come to the conclusion that the government not only knows about these occurances, but will not do anything about it except do anything they can to deny it and discredit or shut up those who can prove it. it will be up to us, as citizens, to stand up to this. it will take undenialble proof and i want to get as involved as i can in the field as humanly possible after exeriencing this.", "photos":

that they were only showing what looked like a tiny spec of light, i zoomed in as far as i could and took a series of photos. the object covered a very large distance in a very short time, and traveled in a straight line. it appeared to be changing shape too. my wife noted that it appeared to be separating into two parts at one point (photo 3322). a lot of the time, i could make out a faint \"x\" inside of the circle which when i examined the photos later on my computers larger screen was very visible when enlarged.  while we watched it appeared to change into several different shapes, although because of the distance it was hard to see with much detail. when i reviewed the 40 separate photos i found there to be several distinct shapes; a perfect square, a 6 point star, a circle with an 'x' dividing it into 4 distinct and equal segments, an inverted upside down 'l', an odd geometric shape with 3 protuberances, and some other more abstract shapes as well. at one point a commercial airliner passed nearby and it looked like it was very close in altitude by comparison. within a few minutes, i could no longer get a good picture as it was too far away. it started directly

green pastures, landscaped by a stretch of wild flowers along side the road as we traveled to our destination. we did make a few occasional stops to take a few photos, being that both of us enjoyed the hobby of photography.\nwe stayed at at the secret river lodge at the yearling restaurant,14531 east county road 325,in hawthorne,fl which is just down the road where marjorie kinan rawlings home

day, which consisted of traveling to a few small towns, which were only, minutes away. we traveled to ft.Mccoy, eureka, mcintosh and salt springs.Along the way we stopped for a few yard sells, art

we took our cups of caffeine down to the creek, which were only a few yards away from our cabin. we sat down upon a bench, sipping our coffee as we listened to a variety of birds sing their own melody and watching the dragon flies dance across the tops of the water. it was a nice morning, it was breezy and overall an overcast day. i sat my coffee down upon the bench and started snapping photos of my surroundings. i then began to walk under the cross creek bridge, which was to the right of where the bench was and snapped a picture of a mirrored reflection of some cypress trees in the water. then went back to our cabin, packed up our things, went into micanopy shops and then headed back to jacksonville, fl.\nwe arrived back to jacksonville, fl around 4 pm and i was anxious to view the photos of which we had taken during our trip. i had taken a total of 298 photos and my boyfriend had taken a total of 136 photos. after uploading the photos, we began watching a slideshow of our trip on my computer. i remember making comment to him about how pretty the reflection was in the water and then he questioned me \" what\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd? and then he pointed to an object on my monitor screen towards the tops of the trees. to be honest at first i thought maybe it might have been a bird but the closer we looked, it convinced us both differently. when i took this

was off my bedroom and that lead to the backyard and the farm fields.  as i was waiting for bubba at the door i noticed how bright the moon was and how odd it was that there was 3 planes in the sky.  in that area air traffic is rare... so 3 planes at one time  was odd to me.  i remember watching the planes going in either direction and that's when i noticed lights flashing out the corner of my eyes.  i looked to my right to see this thing in the sky above the two apple trees in our back yard.  the flashing lights were in fact the band on lights that ran through the center of what appeared to be some sort of craft.  there was red and white lights moving round and round the center.  the craft appeared to be dark or black and like a disk with a bumped up middle. i was shocked and calling out for the dog, soon after what was there vanished right in front of my eyes.  it was there then gone in a flash.  i remember watching the trees and saw it how they moved with the wind and how in contrast this craft moved not at all.  it was silent and still.  i ended up getting the dog inside and shortly after a black helicopter and two silver planes flew above.  i went inside. it's taken me about to report this for a few reasons.  2017 was a very dark and sad year if loss for me.  since i have decided to do this the director of training, ryan stacey had been a great help and i am grateful.\ntwo weeks after this event i saw orange orbs in the farm fields behind the house. maybe about ten of them.  they dashed around the fields and in the trees but i didn't hang around long enough to see for how long.  i closed up the curtains and stayed inside.\non december 9th i had an experience with what i call the reptilian man, it was a 4 day fiasco of which i am sure. i woke paralyzed from the head down in my bedroom and yet could tell i was being moved on my bed.  i reluctantly turn my head from left to up and my eyes looked directly into the eyes of a snake man.  he was populating with me.  i couldn't speak and didn't want to even deal with it or it being a possible dream.  it was not hurting me but i am certain he or it wanted me to see the act.  there was no emotions and no expressions the act was militabt. it was an intrusive act and rape quite frankly that was not violent or unpleasant, i felt nothing. i told myself i would deal with it in the morning and what back to sleep.  when i woke in the morning i was freaking out.\nnow i want to know, why would it even have done that?  i am rh o neg and have two wombs... having children for me is nearly impossible not short of a miracle.  i thought reptiles didn't procreate for any other reason than breeding? since this all happened between nov and dec. my life changed.  i moved to niagara to care for my dying mother and since have left to western canada.  i worry now about many things.  i still am having issues with the idea that these beings can invade your home and head space and there is nothing we can do about it. now i wonder if the beings and ghosts and experiences i have had my entire life are related and worrying that the idea of abductions are now reality! maybe they were always

summer evening in 1982 when i happened to look up towards the full moon.  i was stunned to see a large glowing lime green oval moving slowly,  silently, across the sky.  it was already halfway across the sky when i first saw it. the object appeared to be moving at a constant speed angling in a downward direction.  the entire object glowed the same color and its edges were indistinct with a green glow.  it gave off no other light than this.  there was no \"tail\".  it appeared to be close, no more than 200-300 hundreds yard away and maybe 500 feet in the air.  i stood and watched it move across the open sky and behind a few pine branches.  i watched the object for about 15 seconds before it went out of sight behind a pecan tree, still on a downward direction never having varied its speed.  the object stayed the same color and size for the entire sighting.  when i lost view of it behind the tree i thought it might be headed down into the pasture behind the shed.  i wanted to go see, but first i ran back into the house and grabbed my m1 carbine and put in the 30 round clip.  i shook my sleeping wife and excitedly told her what i had seen and that i was going out to see where it was. of course, she didn't even wake up.  so  i went out the back door and headed out towards the pasture.  i saw nothing, found nothing.  after awhile i calmed down although i stayed outside for about an hour looking up into the sky.  i don't really know what i would have done had this object been hanging around in the pasture.  might not have had the guts to fire on it.  and i remain struck by the fact that had i not been outside and looking up in those few seconds, this thing would passed silently by.  \n\n     now the object was so large and bright and easy to see that i have always been able to remember just what it looked like and how it moved.   so that anyone can see what i saw that night i have drawn the object onto a digital photograph that i recently took of the sky, complete with the full moon and some pine trees just about like they were the night of the sighting.   this photo is a pretty good representation of what i saw in the sky that night.   the red dashes indicate the object's direction. the color and luminosity of the object is fairly accurate.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/4777_submitter_file1__CRW_3981j_RJ.jpg"], "lat":

trying to stay in one place but didn't have full control. i was in awe and freaked out a bit as i knew it wasn't normal to begin with. it seemed to have three separate lights attached to it like a triangle but in a circle. i tried to record the event, but after 3min38sec my video suddenly shut off and could not get it back on. i watched as this light danced around for approx. 45 minutes, then it disappeared and 6 military helicopters suddenly appeared over the hill around where the light was and appeared to be circling. i went inside out of fear. we have a lot of military activity lately

it was dead still, metal, shining as if hot, about 500' up and 300' over, it was about 10 degrees out of plumb. no surface details,on thrust trail,on lights,just hanging there!A cylinder about 40' wide and 80'tall.I asked every one if they even see something at all. they all said ya! i asked each one at a time,what is it. i don't know they said. from laborer to the prime contractor, no explanations. we watched it for about three minutes and every one else lost interest and went to work, i layed down on a stack of plywood and watched it for about 15 minutes longer, but there was on change. evetualy, i went back to work. 5 minutes later i checked on the object and it was gone. i shouldn't have gotten up. every onec in a while i see those guys and quietly ask, remember! they can't deny it. \ni hadn't thought much about it lately, being busy with work and every thing.   (until)!\ni was watching t.V. and there it was on a u.F.O. show.\n                  the  flying  barrel\np.S. maybe the film was of the same event we saw !\n     if so, i would like it on my p.C. wall

could be one single object but i keep on watching it and wanting it not to desappear but instantly it desapeared the one in the front first and then the other.  the were no clouds in the sky, it was completely clear...A beautiful night to see the stars.  i remember by that time mars were near the earth and that night it was beside the moon & that was what i was looking for.  but after that day at the same time i went outside i start to see many of them.  at first i start to think they were satellites but they were to many and some travel in group of two...Some were bigger and others get nearer and their light get bigger, very bright...A white light that i ever seen.  they look like stars, if you are watching the sky you are seeing something like a star and then suddenly it begin to move.  usually they appear from nowhere and they desappear in the same way.  always i see them when the first stars begins to appear but never late at night. i moved to virginia on december 27 and i was affraid i wouldn't see those stars again but i was wrong.  i start to see just a few in a night but since a week ago they are starting to appear again...Many of them and on march 27...(i think is not a concidence the date) but it was the fist time i saw a little one getting out of a big one.  i needed to report this because something is happening whatever they are.  i don't have a good zoom camera but i tried to captured them and i took photos of airplanes and those strange moving stars to compare them...They look very different.  i took the photos with a canon ps510 with a tripod i will sent you pictures of both cropped and putting more contrast to make the objects clearer...But i keep the original ones, full resolution for if you need them.  i will keep on taking pictures of them and hopefully by the end of this month i will get a canon eos20d with a 55mm-85mm lense wich is more better to take this kind of pictures.  i can give you the settings of the camera too if you ask.  i want you to believe me because i have seen them very near and i could not see any shape on them just a great white light.  i got worried because i though that maybe that could be radiation but that is why i am here.  you are the experts, please let me know any info you have if you know something about it.  i can show you in person too if we plan a meeting...I think that is the best proof i can

as we drove over a hill, we saw a pale, grayish white glowing object hovering about 40 degrees over the horizon.  it was of a saucer shape, with a small dome on top.  it was of an unusual brightness compared to the dark evening sky and clouds, and could have been covered up by the held up thumb.  however, it's apparent distance showed it could have been hundreds of feet wide.  it seemed to be about a mile away, above newton.  it appeared stationary, but the movement of the car caused confusion as to weather it actually changed position, as apposed to a changing point of view.  as our car drove down the hill, our new point of view brought the object about five degrees above the horizon.  passing trees and other obstructions brought the object in and out of view, making it difficult to observe flight paths, rotations, etc.  (if any)!  we saw the object several times this way for about ten minutes, and then had no more opportunities to see it.  we wondered if it was a blimp, but the small dome on top makes this rather unlikely in my opinion.  we took a detour into belmont, hoping to see it again from one of the many hills there, but had no more sightings.  it is unknown if the object flew off, or if we simply did not see it because it was blocked from view after that.  after belmont, we gave up and drove home, writing this report immediately after arrival.  during the sighting, it was confirmed that the moon was no where near the object, making it impossible for this to be a bizarre view of the moon.  it is unknown whether there were planes in the area, but this was clearly no plane.  my mother saw the object a few times,  but wanted to focused on driving.  i, riding in the front-passenger seat, saw the object several times.

a cigarette. in the northern sky, going from east to west, i saw a relatively close jet airplane and watched it for a while. there were some thin wispy clouds in the sky, but it was mostly clear and cloudless. while watching, the jet\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds contrail stopped suddenly, and i wondered if the plane was having engine problems since i\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd never seen that happen before, but after approximately three, maybe four seconds the contrail started again. i continued watching the plane wondering if i was going to see something terrible happen to it. my coworker, amy, walked out of the agency\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds nearby ancillary building and she asked me what i was looking at. i told her i was watching an airplane. she said, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdwhat airplane? oh, i see it.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd she laughed and went into the main building while i continued to watch the plane. as the plane started to move off behind a tree to the west-northwest, something in the sky caught my eye above the tree line moving in a southerly direction at a 90 to 105-degree angle (depending on how you view it) from the jet\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds path. it was on about a 75 to 80-degree angle from the horizon in relation to where i was first standing. initially i thought it might be two birds floating together high up in the summer breeze, and i walked closer to the main building to try to get a better view. as i watched, the birds\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd spatial relationship, or aspect to each other, did not change. suddenly i could see a hazy very elongated triangular shape around the two dark spots that i thought were birds. my exact thought was \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdwhat the hell?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd by the time i reached the building (maybe four or five seconds), the craft was at about an 80 to 85-degree angle from the horizon in relation to where i was. after a few seconds, the angle of the sun glinted a light reflection off an apparently metallic hull and showed the craft to be solid with a significantly smaller triangular protrusion at the rear of the stretched triangular shape. the sun reflected off the hull for only a second, or a second and a half. the craft floated (for lack of a better word) in a southerly direction (probably 4 or 5-degrees east of due south) for a full minute or more in plain view. there were no strobes or discernable flashing lights on the craft. i remember thinking that i wished i had my cell phone with me to take a picture, but it was in my office. it had no wings, made no sound, and did not appear to be going fast enough for conventional aircraft velocity to remain aloft. there was to contrail. after approximately one minute (maybe more due to my heightened awareness and concentration), the craft had covered about 35 to 40 degrees of airspace from my perspective. during the observation i never took my eyes off of the craft, but at about one minute into the event, the craft suddenly disappeared. i searched the sky for several more minutes to find the object, but it was gone. it simply vanished. while i could not tell the specific altitude of the craft, the object from my perspective appeared to have the length of a large airplane like a 747 or larger, but was much wider toward the rear of the craft, had a triangular extrusion at the rear, with two large dark spots (that i originally thought were birds) aligned on the undercarriage. at approximately 17:00 hours i told my coworker, traci, that \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdi might have seen a ufo.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd while i kind of laughed about it, i was serious. i have never seen anything like it. i\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm a ph.D. level behavioral scientist, i\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm a trained observer, and i have no theory or remote explanation as to what i saw. it was like

very rural area where most people did not have electricity near us. we had a perfect view of the bay with no fog or clouds most of the night hours that season.\non our first sighting we had just come home from saint john from visiting our familty. it was dark and no moon the first sighting. \ni have mapped out using google maps where we lived and where we saw our first sighting.\nit was my father, mother, brother and sister who witnessed this sighting and none of us knew what it was.\nbeing from that culture we had heard numerous ghost stories of the maritime area and we grew up with that mindset.\nthe object had 3 to 5 lights on it with changeing colours and blinking on and off. we knew it was not a plane, jet or helicopter and because of it being at least 100 feet over the ocean it could not be a ship.\nthe oject moved only slightly for at least one hour, to the point we were getting bored. it did leave and traveled s.E. over the water and went into the bay.\nwe had numerous sightings after that as well as the fishermen telling stories of what they saw numerous times while lobster and cod fishing as far out and 5 to 10 miles.\nim 66 years old now and all of the people and family members are gone. but that being said not one person ever took photos of any of their sightings.\ni just heard about a documentory that showed how the canadian government ask the american navy

nothing ive seen in nevada was as close as these sightings.\nit is my theory that the reason for so much ufo sightings is our tides at the bay of fundy are the most extreme in the world. we have as much as 50 feet difference from low tide to high tide. as well at most of the bay of fundy is not over 300 feet deep which is perfect for marine life to reproduce.\ni am a disabled viet nam veteran

"summary": "The following event occurred on wednesday, april 4, 2018 at approximately 3:00 pm arizona time.\n\nfor around a half an hour i heard a fighter jet flying around the lake havasu city area. after around 20 minutes i was able to spot it directly overhead at an altitude much higher than 30k feet. it was barely visible and i only spotted it for a few seconds, but it was definitely identifiable as a fighter jet. it appeared to be flying in a tight circle. i can\u2019t remember if it had a contrail or not. i lost track of it after just a few seconds, then heard it flying out of the area. after about a minute i heard it come back and again spotted it again flying in a circle and in just about the same spot. i lost track of it again after just a couple of seconds, and shortly afterward it left the area for good.\n\nhaving already seen two unusual incidents in this area in the past couple of months, i bought a canon vixia hf r800 camcorder with 32x optical zoom, which arrived just over a week ago. it\u2019s impossible to track objects on the display when they\u2019re high in the sky in broad daylight, so i just kind of pan the camcorder around the sky in the general area of what i see and hope for the best. the focus was set to infinite and the zoom was set to 32x optical (no digital).  hopefully i can improvise some sort of crosshair on it before long.\n\nafter the second sighting, i went inside and downloaded about 10 minutes of video to the pc and was able to catch something. this first video is of a white object. i don\u2019t know what it is. the perceived direction of flight is probably not the true direction or true speed because i was panning around slowly.  a few seconds into the video you see a commercial jet that was flying either to or away from la. i can\u2019t remember which. the clip between the white object and the jet is unedited. it will give you a real good indication of their relative sizes. for most of the day, i thought maybe the small white object was the afterburner of the fighter jet. later on, i realized that if it was afterburner, then the jet maybe should have been bigger in the film. either way, i don\u2019t know. i\u2019m not an expert. one thing i do remember, though, both times when i saw the jet i don\u2019t recall seeing any afterburner flame. i also know that when i twice observed the fighter jet it did not look anything like the white object in the video. it just looked like a fighter jet flying way up high in the sky. also attached is a screen print of the white object and the commercial jet side by side so you can compare relative observed sizes.\nlist of attachments:\nufo1 - short, real-time unedited video of the white object and a commercial airliner.\nufo1-slomo - edited clip showing white object in real-time then slow motion with orientation changed to fill the video better.\njet-sizes - picture of jet and white object side-by-side for size comparison.",

the sky?.\" the object look like a bright star that eventually faded. i saw a blue light run through the sky, but the blue light(not the light in the sky) turned out to be the light from mcdonalds. we turned right, and dropped her off at her house. this time we continued going down the road. then we turned down the gravel road in which we passed before. as we were driving i told my dad to listen to a song on my ipod. after the song i wanted him to hear another. i had dropped my ipod on the floor earlier that day. i have dropped it on the floor a number of times, but it's never done this. my ipod began to freeze up and nothing worked on it. then the light in the back seat didn't work (it hasn't worked since), but that could be from a bulb that burned out. my dad told me during that, that he saw 3 brights ligts (reddish yellow) shining out in the field right next to us (right where we saw the first light, but that one was in the sky, this was on the ground.Then they dimmed, because i never saw them.) i told him my ipod wasn't working, and i also said i never see any ufo's. well right after that i began looking out the windows to see if i saw anything. i looked in the back window and saw 2 lights that flickered, and then 3 (also reddish yellow.) there aren't any houses out that way either, just a few but their lights would've disappeared in the distance. i thought maybe it was a car, and i didn't say anything for a long time. but the lights started getting brighter and brighter, and faster. i said \"dad look at those lights in your mirror.\" we were far past from when we first saw the lights, and i still saw them very clear and still very bright. we stopped at a stop sign, and then my dad floored it. these lights didn't make a sound, were too spaced out to be car lights, and also car light travels these did not. we finally turned off the road and got on the highway. i looked back and could still see them. then i looked again and a small patch of grass lit up. my dad also said he was getting a really sick feeling in his stomach every time i told him about the lights. after i didn't see them anymore (which was right after the patch of grass lit up), my ipod began to work again. we arrived home that night at 10:12 p.M. approx. but i said before it takes 15 min. to get there, and 15 min. back. we should've arrived home at 10:32 p.M. appox. why did we

get to see the details of it. i strongly believe this is definitely not human made, the strange thing about it, is that it made no sound. i have seen airplanes passed where i live during the night and i know how they look and sound and that one had me very confused. one the video i was able to include the other air crafts. what is also strange is: i don't know if they were aware of me filming them but every time i tried to get closer and a better look, they went behind me and hid behind tress and buildings.", "photos":

(with small attached tail) coming down at slight angle (22-25 degrees)toward the north-northwest (direction we were also traveling) several hundred feet above us  and brighter than any other object in the sky. my wife, the driver, noticed me looking out the window and looked out the windshield a second or two before the object \"burned out\" (her decription) as a way of disappearing. both of us at first thought of a meteor just before impact because it was so close and bright right above us and no smoke or trail remained after the disappearance. there was no other traffic in the area during the sighting and the object seemed to come down in a matter of 5-6 seconds for the mile or so it seemed to travel between 10 and 11 mile roads in roseville (designated road names in our adjoining cities spaced one mile apart). no words were spoken between the two of us during the event perhaps due to the awe induced by seeing such a bright (whitish/blue) object flying alongside us and only a few hundred feet above. as the object disappeared so suddenly, we assumed a meteor being burned up in a final flashing gasp overhead, rather than a craft zipping away in another direction. no report of debris was reported later in the area and no mention of a similar sighting was read or heard by my wife or myself. no report was made to local authorities until a few days later after contact with a member of michigan based mufon. no picture documentation could be obtained, although usually a disposable camera is available in our car's glove compartment. not that night, however, but a new one is now waiting in the car for the next potential encounter. everyone who drives should have one at the ready for such possible occasions.", "photos":

circle around me which scared the crap out of me she never does this and then almost at the same tine her and the two neighbor dogs started barking and i could hear them running around the fence and then i just felt like a tug on my neck to look up so i did i wasn't even thinking tell i saw it. it was a white orb completely silent flying right above me i had to look straight up and strain my neck little to see it and i snapped one picture zoomed in as far as i could and it looked more long in the picture then with my eye then i switched my camera to video mode and started filming while the dogs were still barking and running around my camera cant zoom as good in video mode but i got a few good seconds of it before, like the first, it disappeared completely and just like dissolved in the

a bar in huntington beach for a friends concert. i had dropped them off and continued north on my normal route home the streets were empty and i remember getting that feeling of anxiety or like when the hairs on your arms and back of your neck stand up, like something is about to take place that you would rather not have happen. i remember feeling tense because i was running into every red light although no one was on the road and i couldn't help but feel the sensation that like i was running from something or like as if i was being watched or chased. i remember feeling a small sense of relief every time i would pass another motorist or local seven-eleven, i even stopped to buy a pack of cigarettes although i had quit the month before i think i just needed the reassurance of the cash tender to make me snap out of whatever i was feeling but when i got back into my car i felt it again like an aura was surrounding me in my car. as i continued northbound i lit a cigarette at one stop sign when i saw the first flash, it was as though someone had taken a photo of the street from above, i initially shrugged it off as i was too focused on getting home. there was one more flash that seemed to be 20-30 feet ahead of my vehicle, thats when i looked up and saw what appeared like an arrow tip formation of lights changing colors, it looked as if it was traveling in the same direction as i as the tip of the arrow was pointing in my direction. at first i believed it to be a commercial aircraft or jetliner as we have many airplane traffic by john wayne airport so i tried to ignore it but i remember that the colors kept pulsating like a heart beat so i continued to follow it through my windshield. the formation was composed of perhaps 9-12 lights all at different variations of brightness, the tip was a crimson-red that pulsed to a tangerine-orange, the two rear lights were purple and would change to a light blue, and in between there were white and yellow dimly flickering lights. on this particular night i remember that the moon was not out and the sky was quite dark so i couldn't make out any solid structure they could have been attached to. i was still driving behind it waiting to see if it would fly further away or reveal a flight pattern but it would not move forward nor fall back, it was as though it was hovering at the same speed that i was traveling, and that is when i got the feeling of anxiety again except this time i felt like i was being watched. it would stay with me for about 4-5 miles and finally the leading light started to fall behind, still throbbing the same crimson pattern, it was as though it was changing formation. the white and yellow flickering lights were gone by now and the arrow was now pointing the opposite direction but continued before my vehicle until it began to travel in that direction. these lights were following me for approximately 10 minutes before they past over me, disappearing to my rear. i didn't look back or see exactly where they dissipated but i remember a terrible head ache, in fact when i finally got home and got out of my car i remember vomiting because my head hurt so bad. i wanted sleep really bad, my eyes felt like they were shutting and i couldn't control them thats when my girlfriend came to the door and found me laying in my own vomit, she asked if i was drunk but i explained to her that i had been sober for the later part of the night. i don't remember exactly what time i had arrived home but i saw the clock as i was explaining the incident to my girlfriend and the time was almost four, i remember thinking how could a twenty minute drive from my buddies house to mine prolong to an hour and a half. my girlfriend still doesn't know how long i was laying out on the front porch. this event sticks out in my memory because of the strong emotional feelings of anxiety and helplessness. i have only shared this experience with a select few including my girlfriend and they all say i should seek other witnesses to this event but i have yet to find any.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22833_submitter_file1__uu1.bmp",

pulsing...View was a little shakey in binoculars. i've seen them look bright orangish from what i assume is the reflection of the sun...Hence metallic in nature. i 've even had sightings where they only last for about 15 seconds. the altitudes have varied. some have been eclipsed by cirrus clouds which gives me a sense the were very high, while others like the one in the photo seem to be lower. the coolest aspects about most of the sightings is that sometimes i will just look up and be staring right at it. like that feeling you get when you look up and someone is staring at you. i have tried to look at them through my telescope several times, but by the time i try to focus on them, they are gone. i will continue to try to get better pics and will share any i get in future.", "photos":

white. the beings on the picture have double eyelids bird like features and the look somewhat like humans. in my dreams they look the same. all i would like is someone from mufon to look at the pic. i will even bring the pic to mufon. this is not a hoax. i am also positive that i can help with your research of demensional travel as well. i have given a picture to the u.S. airforce and was told if i value my life, that i will not show the picture. the airforce did tell me that it is one of the militaries auroa projects and they do not know how i got it. interesting huh! the bolts from my government vehicle when i was in the army was also stripped from my vehicle and in an attempt to take my life. so why am i trying to be silence for coming forward with this truth. i am now a disabled vet and have nothing else to lose. the people have to know the truth and i have some evidence to help my claim. this is not a hoax!", "photos":

degrees or so off the eastern horizon). when i had a closer look, there were several points of light forming an arrowhead formation about 30-35 degrees off the eastern horizon  (first picture). i've highlighted the slightly dimmer points of light to emphasize the formation. it was much more noticeable that night. i live right at bay and bloor, and normally see very few stars due to the city lights.\nwhen i looked at the formation through binoculars, i could only see blobs of light. after debating whether it was worth it, i finally decided to pull out my tripod and dslr to grab a few shots. when i downloaded the images, the thumbnails didn't look promising so i forgot about them until just recently. i have seven or so photos, most at fast shutter speeds, so they're quite grainy. i was focusing on the brightest point of light in the formation of lights, but it turns out the other point of light (to the bottom right corner of the closeup images) is more interesting. the last two pictures are of the same two points of light. upon inspection, it would appear that at least one of the light sources appears to be tumbling.The cloesups  were shot through a 200 mm lens with 3 and 4

with my brother. i had just spent the entire day visiting legoland with out of town relatives. it was a very beautiful, warm day that day, so the night sky was very clear and we decided to draw the blinds open, and slide open the patio door to let some fresh night air in. we were just enjoying our beautiful open view of carlsbad from our backyard which faces palomar airport. it is quite commonplace to see planes landing and taking off, even at that time of night. at about 8:45 pm, my brother and i were standing in front of the kitchen window which also faces the backyard. my brother suddenly asks me if i've ever seen a ufo. i thought it was a bit strange of him to ask because we were chatting about a whole different topic at the time. as he was asking me this, i saw him gazing out towards the kitchen window and so i looked out the same way. what i saw were 2 diamond shaped objects very brightly lit, a very golden yellow color. my first thought was they were 2 airplanes in a holding pattern waiting to land at palomar airport. i initially dismissed my brother's sighting of the 2 objects as airplanes and i quickly looked away. however, i quickly looked back since he was still staring out there all this time, and i took an even closer look to see that the objects did not look like planes after all. in fact, in addition to not really looking like airplanes, they were quite large in comparison to the real airplanes in the air at the same time. they were just suspended in air and not really moving anywhere at all. this i found very strange. as my brother and i were coming to realize that we were actually looking at a ufo, the objects instantly disappeared from view!\n\nthen, about 15-20 seconds after that, they reappeared again, but this time as 4 diamond shaped objects with the same brilliant glow and golden yellow color. this time they were in formation, sort of like a parallelogram (slanted square formation). by this time, i called out to my husband who was in our bedroom and also to my daughter who was in another room, to come outside to the backyard to view this strangely beautiful sight. so all of us were standing outside my back lawn viewing this light show which was out of this world, nothing like any of us has ever seen. i felt a bit scared, very excited and in awe, all at the same time. i did not want to keep my eyes away from the light formation in the sky, for fear it would disappear once again. \n\nthis ufo light show went on for about 2 minutes. the objects did not move anywhere, again they were merely suspended in the sky, glowing and staying in their slanted square formation. i still don't even know exactly how far away they were from us. i believe one of the \"diamond\" shaped objects faded a bit and then appeared again brightly during this timeframe. at the end of the light show, the lights simply \"turned off\" and we no longer could see the objects. it was as if someone had just turned off the light switch. they had literally disappeared!\n\ni captured only one picture shot of the 4 diamond shaped objects on my iphone camera, but not at a good close up view. my brother however did capture about 30 seconds of it on video with his camera. unfortunately, it also was not a close up view. his video is available on youtube.Com at this link: http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=9ymzhlarn3m\n\ni'm looking

were about 7 tiny red lights. it was completely stationary and silent. the only apparently stationary things i have ever seen in the sky aside from astronomical bodies were helicopters that sometimes hover very loudly over some incident taking place on the ground. the lights were twinkling as a faint star would. they have to be pretty far way to twinkle. for example the lights on the world trade center (a few miles south) twinkle as viewed from 26th street and 5th avenue. the lights were about as bright as the little red lights on a crane would be high above a city street (more dim than bright) so i checked carefully to see if this was something like that. but clearly no cranes visible. the weird thing was it was a little windy and that thing was yet as still as if fixed to something solid. i went inside to get my binoculars but couldn't find them and i decided, due to ambient lighting, i would not get a very good picture of it. in retrospect i suppose i should have tried to. but i did check to see if it was still there and it was. but then about a half hour later it was not there. i also waited to see if there were any reports of a ufo but there were none. anyway, that is what i saw and it is possible it may not have been widely noticed, or even noticed by anyone as being strange. i don't know. the lights were faint and far away and quiet. but i am reporting it because i couldn't figure out what it was. maybe someone else saw something similar, or can explain what that might have been. the image i attached is not what i saw but from google images was as similar as i

since left me. so about halfway through the hike i came to a clearing i usually stop there and have a drink of water and a snack if i'm hungry. i decided to look up...Maybe id see something..I clearly was not expecting to..But it had almost become a habit, and to my surprise as i did a reflection caught my eye. so i took my phone out and started to record.. it looked like two spheres that were circling but maintained the space between each other almost as if they were connected but separate if that makes any sense.  if you can imagine holding a tiny metal bar with 2 basketballs stuck on each end and you just twirled the middle of the stick around that's the best way i could describe these 2 objects moving through the sky hovering. i didn't know what they were so i was talking a little bit through the video maybe they were weather balloon's.. i was going through different scenarios in my mind i had seen weather balloons before and these didn't look like they were.. i was trying to think of something that fit the description but i couldnt... near the end of the video you can see and hear an airplane or some kind of jet pass below.  after the jet passed i became the bit uneasy and i decided it was time to move on so i hiked the rest of the way about a mile...As i started looking over the video when i got home i noticed two other objects that were smaller and moving extremely fast. i screenshot these at 31 seconds and 44 seconds.  if you look closely you can see these objects fly through extremely fast... i've had the video in my phone and i decided to send it to you guys.. i'm sure you have equipment that's better than my phone :) you can zoom in and adjust contrast or whatever you guys do to clear the picture and video up to make it easier to see anyway...That's pretty much it. hope the video is as interesting to you as it was to me.  ps camp bullis military training reservation is a u.S. army training camp comprising 27,990 acres in bexar

there was a group \nof these grey like figures small like the \nsize of a 1 yr old child but there was one \nthat was a bit taller then the others, they \ntold me things and showed me this huge

was moving in a \nodd like rhythem, the ball was rotating inside  \nthe square, and the square was rotating \ninside the triangle , i can also remember  \ni wanted to touch it but the grey figures \nsaid in a loud voice not to touch it or \n\"we\" all would die, it is not the time but \nyou are choosen to ( but i cant remember) \nwhat else .. ... after that i seen them appear \nfrom time to

"During my daily exercise walk, i spotted a mysterious cylindrical (cigar-shaped) ufo hovering low over a suburban section of richmond, virginia.  i noticed the craft during beautiful weather and clear skies at approximately 6:30 p.M. while walking east down riverside drive on the south bank of the james river.  i was casually scanning the scenery and wildlife along the river, gazing northeast toward the north bank of the river and greater richmond.\n\nthe cigar-shaped craft, perhaps the length of a football field, appeared to be a dull metallic fuselage with light and dark sections fore, aft, and amidships.  there was no writing on the craft or standard markings, no advertisements like you would expect on a blimp, and it did not appear to be a conventional blimp, derigible, or zeppelin of which i am familiar.  \n\ni did not see any fins, stabilizers, rudders, or conventioal propulsion systems.  it was not a balloon, plane, or helicopter. i did not hear any noise coming from the craft.  there were no lights of any kind (at first), no faa port/starboard (red & green) navigation (running) lights, no headlight and no tail light, even though most conventional aircraft would be required to have such lights turned on during dusk hours, especially while operating at extra-low altitude for safety reasons. \n\nthe cylindrical ufo was hovering low, at perhaps 1,500-2,000 feet, over what i believe was an affluent section of richmond.  i used a tall bell tower(spire) at richmond's dogwood dell carrilon (maymont park) as a point of reference.  from my location during the sighting, the tower is a few miles downriver on the northside of the james river, and the cigar-shaped ufo was hovering perhaps .25-.5 mile inland from the river maybe 1-3 miles west of the carrilon bell tower, perhaps over historic agecroft hall.\n\nwhen i saw the craft, i stopped in my tracks and scrutinized it for a couple of minutes, trying to determine whether it was an unusual blimp or cylindrical ufo of possible extraterrestrial origin.  having relatives at nasa, nsa, a late uncle who once was president of the vietnam helicopter pilot's association in washington, d.C., and having myself seen apollo 16 (saturn 5b) liftoff from cape canaveral, a u.S. air force atlas centaur rocket launch, and having been on naval ships and attended the largest airshow in the u.S. three times, this large cylindrical object hovering low near the james river caught my eye.\n\nafter watching the ufo hover silently for about one minute and not seeing any lights, a bright clear-white strobe light of intense magnitude suddenly flashed one time.  the duration was very brief, a couple of seconds.  then no lights for maybe 10-15 seconds.  then another intensely-bright strobe flashed for a couple of seconds except this time the color was red.  these were the only lights seen during my approximate 10-minute viewing.  the two strobe lights flashed from the underside of the ufo at amidships.\n\nmaybe a minute after the strobe lights flashed, the craft suddenly turned slowly on its axis at maybe a 45-degree angle of rotation and then remained motionless in its new position for the remainder of my viewing.  it was as though the occupants of the craft knew (perhaps telepathically) that people on the ground were observing and thus shifted the position of the ufo in order to say \"hi.\"\n\nat this point, i pulled out my cell-phone, activated camera mode, and centered the viewing screen on where i knew the ufo was, but i could not see the ufo on the camera screen because of the long distance, and my phone cam does not zoom, and having photojournalism training, i decided to not take a picture believing that the distance was too far for the camera's capabilities.  the ufo was a couple of miles away on the other side of a wide river during evening hours, etc.  too bad the ets didn't zoom in (across the river) and give me a better photo-op.\n\nat this point, i continued my walk east down riverside drive while keeping the ufo in view when it was not obstructed by foliage on the river bank.  a couple of minutes later, i came to a parking area on the banks of the river near the pony pasture river park.  i saw a solitary man (white or hispanic) in his 20s or 30s sitting indian-style on a large granite boulder in the river a few feet from the bank.  the man seemed to be gazing intently across the river, up into the air, in the directon of the cigar-shaped ufo.\n\ni figured the man was watching what i had been watching, and he was facing away from me and did not know that i was there, so i kept quiet and did not disturb his moment of mystification.  i watched the man eyeing the ufo and the cylindrical craft itself for perhaps one minute, and neither man nor mysterious machine moved a muscle or flinched an inch.  finally, i continued my walk toward home, leaving the man solid as the giant rock that he used as a stool in a pool.\n\nin addition, be advised that some dark unmarked black-hawk helicopters were flying around my area the same day and evening (4-30-10) which has happened during and after previous ufo sightings in my area.  there also was at least one military fighter plane that made a noisy pass at low altitude and high speed which is very unusual, so maybe the government was monitoring and/or chasing the ufo which seems to be par for the course in the united states and canada.\n\nlater that night, friday, april 30, 2010, i was prompted to visit mufon's website and was surprised to see a supporting ufo report from a man named jim in rustburg, virginia which lies 11 miles south of lynchburg and 111 miles southwest of richmond.  jim reported a cylindrical (cigar-shaped) ufo of identical description.\n\njim was much closer to the craft than me, however, and was able to see detail that was harder for me to discern because of the distance during my sighting.  jim's sighting occurred at 6:47 a.M. and my sighting was farther east at about 6:30 p.M.\n\nbetter still, jim was a professional witness and said in his mufon report, case # 23052, that he was an ex-army and navy career man with a naval-intelligence background and \"studied all types of conventional and unconventional aircraft.\"\n\n\"i'm in the army national guard and have seen uav aircraft in iraq, this was different,\" jim said.\n\n\"this object had no fins or wings visible of any type and no engines visible. it was simply a straight cigar or cylinder shape with some object below it or attached to it. it had no rotors or wings and made no noise. it moved slowly and straight. this was absolutely baffling,\" jim added.\n\nafter seeing jim's report and telling my friend, josh, who, with his wife, saw a green sphere/tear-drop ufo descend over south richmond (chesterfield county) in november 2009, i decided to file my own mufon report to perhaps lend more credence to the report from jim in rustburg, va.  \n\nfurthermore, other reputable witnesses, including scientists and government employees, have seen and reported cylindrical and disc-shaped ufos downriver from richmond near the surry nuclear-power plant and also near the north anna nuclear power plant on lake anna in central virginia.  \n\nmy wife and i, and tens of thousands of others, also saw numerous green-sphere ufos descend along the east coast in march 2009.  richmond's daily newspaper, the richmond times-disptatch, ran a cover story which mentioned the lights and accompanying sonic booms but did not investigate adequately and failed to connect this to simultaneous ufo reports aired on tv stations in tidewater virginia.  \n\nthere are numerous mufon reports on file about these sightings.  bottom line: more and more ufos and ets are being seen everyday and everywhere, and each individual must draw their own personal conclusions as to why.\n\nattached are two photos of cylindrical ufos that look similar to the ufo that i saw over richmond, va on friday, 4-30-2010.  the first photo synchronistically features a ufo that was farther east over the ocean off virginia beach, va on august 9, 2009.  the second photo was taken by members of c-seti (center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence) a little farther south off the coast of north carolina's outer banks in april 2009, one year earlier than mine and jim's sightings in central and southwestern virginia.  the c-seti members say they \"contacted\" the extraterrestrials aboard the cylindrical ufo.\n\nnote:  i cropped and enlarged the image of the cigar-shaped ufo over va beach which made the craft more visible but also resulted in pixel distortion around the object because of the extreme magnification, but this distortion is to be expected.", "photos":

looking at that exact spot, at that exact time, i would not have seen this thing or things flying past. i have seen them on three nights in a row, with a friend for a witness and to help see what it/they are. here is how i describe it.....\n   on the first night (3/19)this craft or thing flew almost overhead, from south to north, silently. there were no lights, but you can see that they are like grey-ish \"v's\" or things flying in a formation or attached to a black object.\n\n the first sighting (3/19)i noticed them underneath what seemed like a flat rectangle that was very dark. they passed overhead rather quickly and flew in a straight path out to the horizon. the next day i told my friend what i had seen, and the next night (3/20) we both watched for them at the exact same time, which is 9:35. i had a camcorder running, but recorded only our audio due to blackness. but you can tell just what is happening as we see this thing!\n\n  would you beleive that he spotted these things, or this one thing with silver/grey \"v's\" under it, passing over before i did! i was glad to have a witness, and a second pair of eyes. we traced it till it got to the dark part of the night sky where we lost it. it took about 6 seconds to cross the open sky and pass out of our sight. about two minutes later my friend spotted it (or a second one) flying verticle to its original path. i did not catch that pass though. we were, and still are stumped! but there is still more to tell you about our ongoing sightings!\n\n so, lastnight, (3/21) my friend and i met once more and we had the best sighting yet! \n\nthis mass of about five or so \"v's\" in two very close but offset formations, passed directly overhead! one mass formation had several \"v's\" in it, and flew very close to one anther while the second formation had only two \"v's\" in it. these looked like one big formation though, all passing over (silently and w/0 lights) all at the time, and these \"v's\" did not drift at all between each other. they were just one five peice big mass passing silently over our heads. we lost sight as it again entered the darker part of the sky. after a couple of minutes the formation containing two \"v's\" flew over in the oppisite direction, same path though. my friend had returned inside though, so only i saw that.\n\nyou will not even notice these things if you are not looking for them! you need to look up towards orions belt, for them moving from the south to the north. they are quick and silent and hard to see on account of they have no lights at all.\n\n  i had been relating this to a local astromoner via the web, after each night of seeing this thing in hopes of getting an explanation from him.I hope he joins us soon, as he says he wants to and he has an interest thus far, and night vision gear too.\n\nwe have sketches too, and the audio recording from the second night. we are trying to get someone, anyone, everyone, that wishes to catch a look at this object to come right here in biddeford, maine and see it for themselves. i will point it out myself, if it passes over. my email is [cms/tg/pid] and i want to find out what we are seeing very bad. i will help you get here, and put you right where you will see them if they pass overhead. they are very strange and i am freaked out that they pass at the same time (exactly) each night. i lucked out on the first night, and have gotten luckier and luckier since. better hurry and get ahold of me.\n\nby the way, tonight was cloudy and sprinkle rain. we couldnt see anything due to the cloud cover. i will not stop looking though.\n[cms/tg/pid]", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22449_submitter_file1__FirstB.jpg",

taking random pictures of homes in the area and i asked to see some of her photos. ironically, i had watched a documentary on the phoenix lights a month or two before after stumbling upon it on netflix. it seemed suitable prior to my first visit to arizona lol. after glancing through some of my girl's photos i noticed a peculiar thing in one. in the picture, taken at approximately 4pm, is two houses with a clear blue sky in the background. above the house on the left is six white spots in a slight vee pattern in the sky. after seeing the photo we looked around the inside of the vehicle to see if something could have cause a glare on the window and have simulated that in the pic and found nothing. i asked my girlfriend if she had ever heard of the phoenix lights before and she said she hadn't. my friend, who was familiar with the lights (not firsthand) and had friends that had seen other similar phenomena, looked at the photo and was immediately intrigued. after showing my girlfriend a photo of the phoenix lights sighting (found on google) and comparing it to the on she took we noticed similarities. we have no idea what is in the picture, but it is quite obviously something. i have examined this photo many times an am no further ahead in explaining it.\n\ni should have sent this to you sooner, but i wasn't aware of your organization and only found out from a friend while telling this story. i was hoping you could offer some insight and explanation to what's in this photo. unfortunately, my girlfriend never never noticed the objects when taking the picture and so only took the one pic. \n\nalthough this report is made after the fact, the date and approximate time of the event have been determined based on the image file's date and time stamp. the photo was taken on a samsung g3 cell phone with no filter. nothing has been done to alter the image and you are more than welcome to thoroughly inspect it. it is just as i received it and originally viewed it. i regret that our geo-tagging feature was disabled because we had our phones switched to 'airplane mode' to avoid accidental roaming charges. i have no way of telling you the exact location the

"I was driving in my car with my girlfriend, victoria blackwell, beside me and my 12 year old son, alexander manyhawks wolf-toney, in the back seat. we were coming from nevin platt middle school on baseline road east of cherryvale road, where we had just picked up alexander. he got out of school at 15:30 and took a few minutes to get to the car, so i estimate the pictures were taken between 15:45 and 16:00. \n\nwe were headed west on baseline road to go to taco bell at baseline road and broadway for a snack. the low cloud formations over the flatirons were creating some memorable images, so i stopped the car just west of the foothills parkway and got my sony dsc-p41 camera out of the trunk to take some pictures. \n\nfirst we stopped in the parking lot of the st. andrew presbyterian church at 37th street and baseline road to get a clear view without the power lines going along baseline road. there was an open meadow toward the foothills there, so it was a good location. i took four shots. the first one was without zoom, the other three were zoomed to varying degrees. i estimate the time here as about three minutes total, arriving in the parking lot no sooner than 15:45.\n\n[the second shot, i just realized as i reviewed the pictures to write this report, had a ufo in it, too!!! there was a radiant diamond shape in front of the tree line on the far side of the meadow! we didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt notice that last night! so i have included this image as well as the other along with this report, and have modifed the short description narrative of the report to include this. while taking all these pictures, i was oblivious to anything ufo related going on.]\n\nafter shooting in the church parking lot, i proceeded west on baseline avenue and took two more shots; one without zoom just after leaving st. andrews and another zoomed some while near taco bell. after we went through taco bell, i went south on broadway to ash avenue, where i turned east and immediately turned north and came to a stop on the corner of ashley lane. i estimate arrival to this spot to be no earlier than 15:55. \n\nhere i had a great, unobstructed, close-up view of a stretch of the flatirons and took a slightly zoomed shot to eliminate the foreground and capture a nice scene. a few seconds later, waiting for some traffic on broadway to clear, i took a second shot of the same scene to make sure i had a good image. then we went home, a few blocks away in the martin acres neighborhood. i wish to note that all images were taken from the driver\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds seat of my 2003 oldsmobile alero, with the window fully down to get a good resolution.\n\nwhen we arrived home, we were talking about differing things and planning the evening activities, then i started looking at the images through the view screen on the camera. the first thing i noticed was an anomaly on an image alexander had taken last saturday morning as we passed through castle rock, co on i-25 southbound going to a soccer game in colorado springs. [this image was on the same memory stick and i am submitting a second report to you regarding this other incident after i complete this one.] \n\nwhen i zoomed up on the glowing form above a hot air balloon he had captured, i got excited and i told alexander he may have inadvertently photographed a ufo. then i decided to download all the images on the computer and look more closely at alexander\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds shot on the computer screen. when i did, i decided to print it out, along two blow-ups of the anomaly. \n\nas i prepared to do this, i took a quick look at the last two images i had photographed of the flatirons to see how they turned out. i was stunned to notice a glowing spot in the clouds on the second image. when i zoomed in on it, it appeared to be a pattern of four lights arranged in a circle or diamond pattern in the sky shining through the clouds. then i went about printing an 8\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd x 11 inch photo of this and the other image, and making two enlargements of both these anomalies. i made the enlargements with corel photo-paint 8 and digitally saved them as separate images. \n\nthis was all very exciting to me, as i have had many sightings in my 56 years of living, but never have had the blessing of capturing any of them with a camera. victoria and i had attended the recent mufon event in denver. we were moved by the documentary we saw of compiled evidence from a mexican journalist. victoria then saw two ufo\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds seemingly playing with one another in the sky off c-470 near lone tree, co, the next morning as she went to work. after that, i had prayed for an opportunity to get a photograph or video, but had no idea i was photographing any of them yesterday. and to discover while preparing this report today that i serendipitously photographed two separate ones within 15 minutes was wild!\n\nand unbelievably, the encounter was not yet over. while i was immersed in the profundity of having finally captured a ufo on camera and the delight of my son preceding me with his picture from last weekend, alexander noticed a red balloon we had placed behind the horn of a bison skull hanging on a wall of my living room last friday evening was beginning to shrivel. he also noticed the seven others in the room i had brought home for him from a celebration at the denver va medical center i had attended last thursday were just fine. so he pulled it down and examined it.\n\nafter a few moments, alexander told me there was a hand print somewhat smaller than his on the balloon. this was curious enough to get my attention, and we continued to examine it together. i have decided to detail this in another report to you immediately following this one. i was convinced that there was a strong possibility an alien entered my home tuesday evening and handled this object, leaving some remarkable impressions which i have documented with my digital camera and a video.\n\nindeed, at this point, i am ready to methodically document all my encounters with your organization and you will be hearing more from me. and i am reasonably certain i now possess an extremely valuable artifact providing evidence of an alien presence, so i hope to be in contact with one of your associated scientists in the near future for a scientific analysis of the balloon and the apparently heat or chemically-formed impressions on its surface where it was handled by some unknown life-form.\n\nsincerely, \n\nhenry c toney jr\nmail: pob 3733, boulder, co 80307-3733\nemail: inritoni@att.Net\nvoice: 720-404-6063\nfax:

again, then moved around making different formations. i only recoginized one, it appeared to be the little dipper. video 3 after that they all came together and formed a v pattern and slowly headed

northeast to southwest), and was trailing orange flames behind it. the ball was engulfed in flames too and the \"rolling\" motion was very clear. if my memory serves, we also heard a deep roar coming from it. i remember watching it for as long as we could; it was at least a minute because it rolled very slowly. we were both saying to each other that we had never seen anything like it before and had no idea what it could be. it was eventually out of sight; i can't remember if it disappeared beyond the horizon or behind mountains. the time was near sunset but there was still a good amount of

spent the last hour before dusk, planting beans and peas in our plowed field.  i had just finished for the day and was standing at the ne corner of the field, with a clear 360 degree view of the sky.\n\ni was observing a few stars barely discernible above me when something made me look to my south.  suddenly a bright white/orange light appeared, then 4 more next to (east of) it.  the four came on all at once.  they all blinked off at the same time.  these lights were approx. 10 degrees above the southern horizon.  they lights only appeared for a few seconds each time.\n\ni ran to the house, yelling for my husband to \"come quick, ufos!\" (i didn't know what they were at the time, still don't). i grabbed my binoculars and by the time we got to the field, the lights were gone but as we stood there, a light appeared, then 3 more in a loose triangle formation.  they all blinked out at the same time, then slightly further east they all appeared again.  each time they blinked out, they would appear a bit further east until i could no longer see them because of the treeline.\n\nmoments later, we saw at least 1 jet flying into that area and it was tiny in comparison to the lights.\n\nafter the lights were gone, my husband said, \"what is that?\" he pointed up at about 65 -70 degrees ese and said, \"watch that star, it's moving.\"  i watched it through the binoculars.  i told him it was probably a satellite but then the object did something that satellites do not do, it altered course from ene to due east and then a few moments later, it disappeared.\n\ni contacted robert powell (mufon) and described what i had seen.  we discussed it and he sent me a video of flares he had taken sometime earlier.  my husband (a military aviation veteran) and i watched the video.  the flares in the video did not resemble what we saw tonight.  my husband is adamant that what we saw were not flares and i do not believe they were either.\n\nevidently we were not the only ones to see these lights tonight.  i have a blog called \"lights in the texas sky\".  a short while ago, someone posted to my blog what they also saw this evening and it matches very closely to what joe and i saw.\n\nhere is their report/comment:\n\n\"tonight 3/31/10 around eight thirty pm we saw about 10 flashing lights. it would appear for about 1-3 seconds as a bright orange light, dissapear for about the same time, then come back. but when it reappeared, rather than there only being one there would be multiple. this is about our forth time to see these things and we only see them at night but they are always the same thing. an orange light that flashes a few times then dissapears and we dont see it again the rest of the night.\" \n\nif i hear back from the poster, i will send any information to mr. powell.\n\ni am including in this report, 3 depictions of what joe and i saw.\n\nthank you, sw.", "photos":

"hello mufon,\n   at night on thursday, april 15, 2010, three friends and i went to a beachside park slightly north of venice, florida, for some skywatching.  ufo's are often reported in this southwest part of the state. the night\nwas clear, and for the first hour we saw nothing moving through the sky except planes and helicopters, both flashing lights and making plenty of motor noise.  about 8:31 we noticed a small cluster of lights moving together toward us from over the gulf -- completely silent with no lights flashing. as they they moved closer to the beach, a bright beam of light suddenly shot down from the group of moving lights, scanning a small area of shallow water offshore for only about 10 to 15 seconds. the cluster then passed over the beach about a quarter mile south of where we were, disappearing inland toward the east.\n  luckily i captured two photos, thinking that when i processed them in photoshop i'd see the lights connected to some outline of a plane or helicopter. the mysterious five lights are very small in the original raw\nimages, so i had to enlarge and crop the images quite a bit, lightening them overall and increasing the contrast to reveal stars against the dark sky.  although the lights are pixilated in these enlargements, it appears that they are not attached to a solid body of any kind (unless it is invisible.) between the five lights, there are stars shining from behind and through the areas where we might expect to see some indication of a fuselage or other structure supporting the lights.  what are your thoughts?  naturally, we are quite curious but not surprised, since all\nof have seen ufos before. (enlarge to 200% to see a bit more detail.)\n  in the data file of my camera, the attached file #1 was taken at 20:32:27, and file #2 was taken at 20:32:49. you can see in these two images that the lights moved in relation to background stars. for file #3,\ni exaggerated the contrast dramatically, still looking for some kind of\noutline of a solid body or structure to which the lights were attached --\nnothing seen.\n  if you would like to look at the original raw images, i can send them so you can see that no object in the photos was added, deleted, moved or altered in any way.  \n  my three friends can attest to witnessing this event.\n \nsincerely,\n \npete carmichael", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/23048_submitter_file1__1.UFOLIGHTSVENICE.TIF",

star that also looked to be very close, it was odd enough for me to text my friend to ask him to look at it with me (i have always been an avid observer of the skies and all weird things in it). he agreed that it was very strange, and we went off to bed. around 3 am, i was still awake and still curious about the object, especially whether or not it was still there. so i went outside alone for another smoke. this is when my memory starts getting very fuzzy. i remember locating the object very easily. it was like venus but much larger and even brighter. i took out my cell phone to take a video. i couldn't pick up the light with the normal light effect on so i switched to a negative light filter. i was happy with the results and also very suprised at how much closer it seemed. this is when the object began moving erratically. i remember just being in awe at how it was moving, up down zooming to right above me to miles away then right back. it was incredible! after this, i have no memory until around 5:30am then nothing again til 7am. my memory around 5:30 is of me sitting on the front lawn with my cell phone video on, smiling, very happy and saying out loud \"come on! this is your last chance for me to videotape you before everyone starts waking up! come on out! it's ok!\". around 7am i started talking with the residents from the house about it, though i didn't remember what i had told them until i asked the day after. i rememeber thinking that i had been with ghosts and that was what i told them. i actually told them that i had \"a rough night\", that i had seen orbs in the driveway, that there was a presence that communicated with me, that the presence wanted me to have my cat buddy with me. i also had left a voicemail for my twin sister telling her about the star that was moving when it was happening. she said i was crying but that it didn't sound like i was sad but rather that i was witnessing something incredibly beautiful and amazing. i also remember when i was talking with my friends that i had my cell phone out, trying to make sense of these videos taken in negative effect. i remember showing them and asking \"what the hell can that be? where am i that i could film the roof?\" later that day i went to download the videos and pictures from my phone to my computer, where i saw i actually had 12 videos of that night already on it plus another 6 on my phone! i must've been going up to my room during all of this to empty my phone when it ran out of memory! so i have 18 videos and 15 pictures. it took months to see any of it somewhat cleary as i don't have the equipment to view the videos in their positive image other than my cell phones which do not do these videos justice. there are videos of me with my cat, at least 2 small craft, an entity opening and closing my car door, more entities, multiple orbs in multiple colors, one of me in my bedroom filming out the window of 2 hovering craft and then this very strange and geometrical light on my ceiling...You just have to see them. i felt very strange after all this and have since constantly seen lights, felt a presence, and mostly seen hovering lights in the woods where there are absolutely no homes. i actually didn't sleep with the lights out for months and have gathered hundreds of videos. i am looking for someone to help me view these videos to put some of my fear to bed. that my one memory was of me laughing and happy, i know no harm came to me, especially since my cat interacted so readily with me during all this. but every time i get that feeling (feels like electricity running through my skull and the outter edges of my vision starts to flutter with a white light) i just get terrified, and i don't want to be terrified of something with such majesty. i also feel burdened with the reality that i have the videos that i've always wanted to see when i hear someone has evidence of ufo's. that this entity, this phenonema allowed me, encouraged me even to film it. i also have had very strange things happening with my skin and my hair. white thread-like but plastic-like substance coming out of my pores and out of my hair, my nose...Just weird stuff and i can't help but think that being that close to these objects had some sort of effect on me. buddy had the same symptoms but he has since disappeared (a couple weeks ago). by the way, i didn't click the abduction option above but the interaction the videos show along with my loss of memory as well as the height at which i seem to be filming from, i don't know what happened. i really don't.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/42078_submitter_file1__ThatNight.ShowOff.3g.3gp",

elevation on the slope of an 11,000 foot mountain. this gives us an unobstructed view to the east of at least 40 miles.\nanother feature of our location is that we get some of the most fabulous sunrises i have ever witnessed. because we are on a mountain we get some weird and wild winds, as well as phenomenal cloud formations. \nso, on the morning of 1-19-2018, i was up early and decided to set up a time-lapse to play with. i put the gopro up on my porch and set the interval between shots to 15 seconds. (yeah, that's a long time, but this was my first test.) apparently i only ran the test for about 12 minutes, since i had gotten a late start and dawn was already in progress. once the sun was up, i walked out and shut down the gopro. \ni downloaded the files onto my computer and really didn't think any more about it. i captured more sunrises, on other days and around the middle of february i finally got a piece of software that i could stitch the individual frames together with into a movie. so, around the 13th of february, while i was rendering the first video, i saw something in the sky that wasn't moving in the clip. watching it again i noticed it was a very windy day in the upper atmosphere and the cloud ceiling was probably right around 11,000 feet. and there is this \"object\" in the clouds...The clouds are going around it and it is stationary right at the level of the clouds. \ni only captured 46 frames of video. the camera has an 8k pixel count. this object was less than a mile from my house. i have no idea what it was or how long it was hovering there. i did not actually ever see it live... only on my video.", "photos":

lights)[object-1 and object-2], 1 possible satellite (dim light), 1 huge (blimp size) ufo (low altitude, no lights).  during the late afternoon of the same day before the night event,  i think i captured on camera an ufo at close range which is the reason why i decided to watch for them possibly occurring at night too. \n\n  while watching at night, i spotted object-1 at an altitude height area typical of spotting either high altitude commercial jets or satellites.  i had my camera set up on a tripod; however, this object came towards me from a high angle in the sky which thereby caused me to dismount the camera and take hand held pictures. while taking pictures of it, i saw with my eyes through the camera viewer it appearing to be perfectly spherical in shape, dullish gray color with a hint of black color. it did not appear to emit light; however, it did appear to reflect city ambient light.  from my best estimates in size via experience with camera shots at that distance, i would estimate the size of object-1 similar in size to a large weather balloon size but not the shape of it.  viewing it with no camera but with eyes only:  the object-1 appeared to be at a high altitude, traversed slowly typical of a satellite or drifting balloon heading east, barely noticeable in the sky until spotted, no audible sound were heard. duration of object-1: 46 seconds starting at 20:41:31.  object-1 never changed in shape or in light intensity throughout the entire observation of it. pictures were taken (no tripod); faint light can be seen upon adjustments of lighting in photo program. \n\n  object-2 similar to object-1. heading: south east. duration: 65 seconds starting at 20:55:58. object-2 never changed in shape or in light intensity throughout the entire observation of it. pictures were taken (no tripod); faint light can be seen upon adjustments of lighting in photo program.\n  \nobject-3 (possible satellite) 5 pictures were taken with a camera on a tripod until object observation was lost upon readjustment of camera view. no enhancements required except via d-lighting low. light characteristic of 1 second exposure is not typical to any known jet or plane light pattern.  object-3 had a level flight coarse, but interpretation of light characteristic is unknown at this time.  however from past observation of satellites with eyes only, object-3 appeared to be a satellite with minor fluctuation in light intensity. duration: 16 seconds starting at 21:00:46\n\n  object-4 (blimp size) was unquestionably an ufo of some sort in my opinion.  i first noticed the unknown object within a 1 mile range with my eyes only.  this object had no lights on it nor did the object emit any lights.  the size of the object is comparable for that distant of being an extremely large commercial jet, or comparable in size to a large c-31 military transport jet, or comparable in size of a goodyear blimp.  it was almost unnoticeable while traveling except it almost stand out from the background scenery as a large and dark, elongated object traversing very slowly in speed which the speed is very comparable to a blimp speed.  the altitude is estimated to be at the altitude of a blimp flying, or at the altitude of a landing-approach of commercial jet.  i had a difficult time trying to locate object-4 with my eyes while trying to locate object-4 through the camera's viewfinder since the viewfinder on the camera has a darken filter.  once i was able to locate it on the camera, what i saw quite literally sent chills down my body as being startled but not frighten,; yet,  i continue to take pictures of it with the remote. the object appeared to be a huge eye looking thing.  it is possible that it might be a blimp because of it elongated shape, but i doubtful of that.  at the ends points of the object, it appeared to come to a point similar to how our eyes come to a point at both ends.  a blimp is more rounded at those ends.  in the center of this object structure appeared to be a wavering, huge darken, circular-like mass area as in some similarities to the iris of a dark, color eye on a person.  outside the darken circular area but in the area that comes to a point, the color was of darken, yellowish color with maybe a hint of orange in it.  while looking at it through the camera, it appeared to me to have a mean-like look which that part is what sent chills down me.  i managed to take 4 pictures on the tripod before i completely lost sight of the ufo including searching with my eyes only.  only one pictures shows up with no enhancements required; plausibly, one of the search light from the light show that was taking place near my location possibly lit the object up which was pure luck for me. duration: 19 seconds starting at 21:15:34. pic-1 resembles (to some extent) the object which i saw through the camera's viewfinder. further cropping and resizing (pic-2) shows something completely unknown and bizarre yet enlightening in features as to being unique.\n\n  about 10 minutes later, a jet making the sounds similar to a fighter jet headed nw in direction towards the commercial airports but in opposite direction of the ufo's heading.  i took 3 pictures of that jet.  now i know how all this sounds with \"light show\" and \"eye looking\" terms used; however, this event did take place, and this is not a concocted or exaggerated event.  this is a true chronicle of the event and how it unfolded that night.", "photos":

before. the best way i can describe it is to say that it reminded me of a 2-tone car alarm siren coming from approximately 1-2 miles away. i did think that was what i was actually hearing but this sound was in perfect timing with the craft being overhead. this sound would disappear as soon as the craft were out of sight and then reappear as soon as the next pair came into sight over the horizon.\n\nthey were perfectly smooth in their flight and were travelling at what i would say was a slighty slower speed than normal commercial passenger aircraft. the overhead height was

"On march 15, my wife and i had just visited the little a le inn on highway 375 in rachel nevada. we left and drove back down 375 and pulled off the road just about a mile past mailbox rd. i believe the time may have been approximately 9:00-10:00 p.M. (pst). in one of the videos my wife mentions 12:00 central time; this was the end of the sighting. i parked the vehicle at more or less a forty-five degree angle to the road with the headlights pointed towards the glow of las vegas in the sky. this glow also illuminated the mountains and landscape (silhouette etc.). \n we had pulled off the road to see the stars in the remote sky; we were not there to catch a sighting (13 years married with no break from the kids-type trip). we were in a hurry to get back to vegas but decided to stop along 375. we initially left the car running and lights on with my wife sitting in the passenger seat. i left the car and came around to her side and proceeded to watch the horizon. once we both saw how many stars there was i told her to turn off the car and step out with me. we had both been standing there for just a few minutes trying to get both the digital cameras and the video camera to pick up what we saw. just then i noticed a bright object (not a shooting star) high up in the sky headed towards vegas. \n this object was very small or very high but did not exhibit normal characteristics of a plane. there were no flashing strobes or sound from engines etc. this object being small, and disappearing quickly, did not really grab my attention. however, moments later from the same direction the object disappeared from came two lights flashing. they seemed motionless and as if they were affixed to each other. in other words it seemed that they were attached by a bar or direct line etc. they flashed for a while before i even considered pointing the camera at them. there are many cattle crossing lights of similar color along 375. it finally dawned on me that those lights had to be miles away and could not possibly be the same type of lights; these lights were much brighter and intense. \n i pointed the video camera at the objects and could not pick them up until i turned on night shot. the two larger lights were very visible; in addition to this were two other smaller lights that could not be seen with the naked eye. we watched these objects move from left to right going in the direction of rachel. as the two primary objects (po) moved in this direction you could see other smaller lights moving around them. they would zip from one point to another. as they shot away their illumination would dim. in all probability, there were probably more objects out there than we captured or even saw. i based this on the fact that after watching the video, you can see objects you could not see with the naked eye.  \nthe po traveled from the direction of vegas until they were almost perpendicular with 375 before we lost sight of them. we waited for a few more minutes and then decided to leave. we had only gone about a mile or two when my wife screamed \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdthere they are again\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. this time the po were only a few miles from us (i am guessing about this, their contrast in the night sky made this hard to tell but they were definitely very close to us).  in the video i try to use the ground as both a reference and to help make the camera focus as it should. as you will see in the video, based on the ground etc. it seems that they were right on top of us but i could not figure out why we were not being dowsed by the light. also, i did not see any report of this light on the ground. it was as if the light did not travel or radiate like normal lights. this was very strange for something so bright and intense.\nthe po made very slow movements. the additional smaller objects seemed to jet around the larger ones and were more agile.  in one of the videos i think i see something like electricity or sparks coming from the po. now the strangest thing was that the po seemed to merge with each other right before they \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdblinked\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd off or out. also, strange is that i heard my wife say they are gone but she says this at least a second or two before they \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdblink\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd out again on the camera (not sure why there was a delay between her eyes and the camera). in the stills there seems to be a structure present.  \nas far as feelings went, i think we were just in amazement of the objects. when they reappeared closer to us the second time i think we were both a little frightened. it seemed to be checking us out. we got a little more worried about the remote location and the fact that there were other objects moving around the po. i do believe that if we stayed there, the objects would have come closer. i had no feeling whatsoever that the event was over with when we left. these objects were clearly doing something related to that general locale. we decided to leave based on the fact that each time the lights went off, they came back on closer. \n\ni am not sure how to answer the radio button at the bottom of this screen. what third parties are you referring to?  all i am really seeking is if someone knows what these images are and just how close they were to us. i will submit the videos after speaking to someone in person via phone.", "photos":

thought it was weird at first so then i started hearing noises like a huming sound so i looked out my window but didn't see anything so i thought i was just hearing stuff so i went back to sleep. \n\n2- the first time i noticed anything was around 11:12 p.M. when my bedroom door opened and i could hear something walking beside me and standing beside me and of course i had my eyes closed so i didn't open them until i started hearing something in my mind saying, \"don't be affraid. we no harm.\". so thats when i started to really freak out so i opened my eyes and i could barely see two dark figures, one standing beside me on my right and the second in front of me. so i closed my eyes hoping it was a dream but then things got very real. i could feel being lifted up and being brought out back where i could see a small oval shaped craft in my backyard and another triangle craft hovering right above it just few feet higher. \n\n3- i thought the object was an actual ufo the first time i saw it of course. it was oval in shape, had about ten windows on the front of it, the color of it was dark grey and the second craft [triangle craft] was black with small diamond shaped windows around it. \n\n4- like i stated in the 3rd paragraph, the first object was oval in shape, ten windows on the front side and grey. the triangle ufo was complete black with tiny diamond windows around it. i thought it was weird that the oval craft landed and the triangle craft hovered right above it. \n\n5- my god, i could feel something for sure. i was like, terrified. on a scale of 1-10, 1 being not so scared and 10 being terrified, i'd have to go with 15. once i was aboard the oval craft the only thing on my mind was, \"how was i going to get out. . or am i ever going to be released...\". so once i was aboard the craft it seemed just calm, i was placed on a silver table while about three beings came by me looking at me then talking. as for me, i don't know alien language so i have no idea what they were saying. then one of the aliens came next to me and showed me this blue light then i blacked out. so i guess i was out for about twenty minutes because i awoke on the table while one of the aliens took my hand and had me step off the table and walk around. i looked all around the craft and it was just walls and rooms and windows. nothing very interesting but i did get released about ten minutes later. \n\n6- after being aboard the craft the suppose \"leader\" of the aliens, came beside me and showed me off the craft. i could hear him talking saying like, \"we're sorry we terrified you. these are my students for a complete experiment. we will be back soon so do not panic.\". so of course i didn't know what he meant when he said, we will be back soon so don't panic. so he showed me to the back door of my house and opened it while i stepped inside and looked back outside while the leader walked back inside the craft and took off in less then 15 seconds. that's about it.\n\n-note- the first picture of my drawing is the picture of the two ufo's and the alien who took me aboard the craft. the second picture i found to be looking like the exact leader of the aliens who i saw.-", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/42109_submitter_file1__422233147946188680060631360465n1.jpg",

dark out, and there was nothing to use as a reference point, other than what we believed to be a plane. we didn't hear any sounds, nor saw any beams of light, etc coming from any of the objects. we

looking at its so detailed and i think a bug is on the lens,so i look no bug i look back to where im shooting and there it is.And i can see why i thought it was a bug its got some windows and looks

shot i stay there where i was for several minutes just looking over the area.It then dawns on me that i might be breathing in some of this black smoke and im not sure the way the wind is blowing.So i wanna leave because this ship shot out a bloom of black smoke the color ive never seen before.One bloom while it hovered and you can see it above the craft,the other one thats being shot out i didnt see untill i exposed the picture,but at least i got that much,and theres two orbs in the air above it and one in the water i didnt see either untill i exposed the picture.I would like to mention also i didnt expose these pictures for over a year,i just wanted to forget about it.But im ready to release it mostly because i cant get anyone to look at these pics and tell me what the hell this is i

disappearing. i watched the spot for several minutes and scanned the sky in that area for sometime before think that i may have seen something unusual. the next evening while shopping at the local acma supermarket in elkton, i mention this to my checkout and he said \"you aren't going crazy, i saw it too!\" we talked about it for several minutes both wondering aloud to whom and how we could report it. \nfor myself, i have seen several object that i could not identify and have never before know a place to report them.\nthis one did not go in a straight line and that is what caught my

30+ seconds and ran to get my cell phone camera in the next room. i was gone less than 15 seconds but when i got back, it was gone (and, very oddly, my cell phone went down, then came back on while i

\"non-believer\" and is not much of an internet user, so he hasn't had exposure to what may be posted by others. he called me on the morning of march 6 to talk about another issue, and near the end of the conversation said, \"oh, by the way, i saw the strangest thing last night while driving up my road.\" he came to a stop sign and happened to glance through the top part of his windshield just in time to see what he first thought was a shooting star. he then realized it was not a meteor and told me he still wasn't sure what it was. i asked him to describe it and when he said \"triangle shaped,\" it got my attention quickly. he said it was moving extremely fast, much faster than anything he had ever seen before, and covered the sky in 2 or 3 seconds. it made no sound and traveled in an arching motion like it was following the curve of the earth. he estimated that it was at least 10,000 feet up, maybe more. he also said it had to be quite large due to the altitude and relative size when compared to the stars. it was traveling from north to south towards tarentum/harmarville area. i asked him if he could sketch it and he said he could. he described the huge light on the bottom of the craft, and the outside edges were lit along the entire length, and several large lights in the back. the lights seemed blurry/hazy, and left sort of a streak, but he figured it was due to the extreme speed. i went to his house the following weekend and brought along several print-outs of triangle craft since he had never seen a photo of one before. he was amazed to see how close his drawing was to others. to this day, he said he still doesn't believe in ufos, but he is sure that what he saw was not any type of known airplane or military jet.\n\ni re-sketched the craft based on his drawing, which was on a torn out line piece of paper, so i figured it would scan clearer if i re-did it. the main difference to note on this craft is the lack of lights at each point. all of the lights were white and had no blinkers. i am hoping someone else out there has witnessed this type of craft, especially the extreme speed. he told me that if he didn't happen to glance up at just the right moment, he would have never seen it.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/23130_submitter_file1__Triangle3-6-2010.pdf"], "lat": "40.62304", "sighted_at": "2010-03-06"},

\"change\" into the saucer shape right before his eyes. they hovered for some time 25 yards away. larry and my father were hiding underneath a weeping willow tree, and actually observed them through the scopes of their 7mm magnums for, what larry said to be, forever. it's hard to tell how long because the sheer strangness of what they were witnessing could have made their time estimates horribly innaccurate. larry said they released 10 or 12 glowing red balls that descended and lit up the forest. he said he could here them whisling as they originally approached, and \"winding up\" with a crescendous wail before flying off and meeting high in the sky. he said the red balls stuck around longer, but eventually sped off into sky and were absorbed by one of the crafts. he then said, they disappeared into space in the blink of an eye, and were gone. larry's story also reeks of missing time. they said they couldn't believe that it was so late(early in the morning) when they made it back to camp. a game warden was waiting for them when they arrived and was \"absolutely berzerk\" after witnessing them himself. i have a wonderful recording of larry shearin telling the story. it is absolutely fantastic. i seriously doubt that they would ever make something like this up. i have taken this as fact every since i first heard the story when i was a little boy. this is actually the

that this is a primary document concerning a very real ufo encounter. the missing time possibility especially disturbs me, because i was my fathers first child 5 years later. i know that people report

gather in a group in mid air! - the ufos were not easily visual due to the small size (perhaps a little bigger then a basketball), white color, and a strong blending sun. there was also a few people

watched it for a about 20 seconds and it began to move about but not leaving the area of the sky.\n\ni came inside and got my step-son and his friend who had been up all night playing x-box. as i walked back through the house i grabbed our small digital camera that was able to shot video too, but knew from experience that it would not shot hardle a thing at night, but knew that i would have audio.\n\nthe boys came to the back door of the sun porch and i pointed it out and right away they saw the movement. i have seen stars in the past that will dance around because of atmosphere., but this was doing alot more. i tried to turn on the camera, but the batteries were dead. we watched for about 1 minute and i decided to go in and find some batteries and in the mean time i woke my wife up and told her.\n\ni returned in less than a minute and started the camera and introduced the boys and we began to detail what we were seeing. during this time we saw flashes near and in the same portion of the sky in blue, greenish and red colors. all during this time too we watched the object brighten and dim quite a few time and move around in all different directions but still stay in the same portion of the sky. we also saw steaks of light go past the area. my wife had joined us but watched the object from inside the sunroom.\n\nthe boys decide to go in after about 5 min since they were cold. but i contiuded to observe. i turned the camera off after another few mintes.\nwent to the bath room and returned to the sun room where my wife was still watching. i started filming again and making some more observation and commenting for i am planning to post this to my youtube account.\nafter another few minutes i turned the camera off and decided to finish getting ready for work. \n\ni poked my head out every so often to check on it and during one of these times  i saw the object shoot out a light out the left side, that faded away. it continuded to stay in the same portion of the sky until the sun came up. it stayed bright even though the rest of the stars faded but it disappeared soon after.\n\nwhen down loading the video from the camera the time i found that the part i recorded in the sunroon didn't. \n\nhow should i feel about this hmmmmmmm...... i don't know because as of now i have seen more ufo's than any one man should see in any life time. and lots of differt

solid orange lights. normally they pulse a tiny white and red light.\n  on our way home we couldn't stop gazing upon the lights, we were fixated trying to figure out what they were. they weren't moving in any specific direction just kind of motionless. then one light noticeably went to the left, and another to the right, and then disappeared. then there were three left.\n  we thought chinese lanterns because of the color. but that means the lights would move with the wind or move in a general direction, which they didn't, and even chinese lanterns start to dim over time and distance. these were noticeable bright orange lights. once we hit route 30 we started heading east, traveling toward the lights.\n  we started in frankfort and ended up about 10 miles east (past chicago heights). over that course of time the lights formed a triangle formation, vertical line, horizontal line, and staggered vertical line, and then went to two lights. it went to two lights after it formed a perfect triangle.\n  when it became two lights they seemed to create distance from each other, and close back up. they again formed a vertical and horizontal line, and when they were in the lines they moved simultaneously and in unison; keeping a perfect distance from each other moving down, up, left, and right (slowly but precisely).\n  when the lights were vertical, the one on the bottom moved to the left of the other one (while the other one remained motionless) and then slowly disappeared (within 3 seconds). then approximately a minute later the last light disappeared.\n  we turned around because we were in a bad area. so then we started heading west, the direction we just came from, and my girlfriend told me to look behind us and see if i could see anything. sure enough

after a while i could only see half of it as i live in an apartment and some house was blocking the rest of it. the lights were really high in the sky and they got really really bright and then they got dimmer but they never stopped shining they just got really hard to see, not the pyramid ones but the other 6 around it and one of them was over the formation it was larger then all of them and glowing bright orange i saw all of this at 9:30 and it lasted til about 11:30 then all of them dissapeared except for one. it just sat there for a half hour and then i decided to stop watching it and when i came back it was gone. i tried taking pictures but for some reason the lights wouldnt show up on my digital camera i pointed it in there direction but nothing happend the street light popped up and in 3 pictures i dont no im not to sure what i got its very strange it dosent look like what i could see with my eyes but when i took the picture it was there one of them is a tiny red light that you can see moving rapidly in two pictures i took simultaneously after the other. the other is a bright blue blob and i think i messed the other ones up because of the way i was shacking i dont no but i was very anxious when it happend and my heart was beating really fast and i could not calm down i thaught it was a tower they use to make sure planes dont get to low but they were to high up in the

sat there in place, and now there gone. and they only come back some nights its weird, oh and they arent stars unless stars get bright and fade and all the other stars in the universe blew up because

"summary": "Note:  this story has been posted on my website alien reality.  i see and photograph orbs and alien/trans dimensional beings all the time and typically don't report them to you.  i did fill out one previous report and after the initial interview over the phone i did not hear back from the investigator.\n\nthis last saturday, august 18 at about a quarter till one in the afternoon i managed to witness and record what to me is among the most amazing things i have ever had the privilege to view. i had made arrangements to go over to a friend\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds house that afternoon and right prior to leaving i was doing some chores in my backyard and noticed that the clouds that day were particularly thick and many were shaped very oddly.\n\ni went inside to retrieve my camera and once outside again i began snapping photos.Suddenly, a bit behind me to the west i saw what appeared to be a flying or tumbling black object. the moment it registered in my head that this was all sorts of unusual, the object was directly overhead. it was traveling rather quickly despite its awkward tumbling and occasional diving motions. soon afterwards it was to the east of me and that is when i began to snap photographs of this thing that i had just seen in the sky.\n\nmy first thought was that this was a trash bag or some other sort of debris flying in the sky which sometimes happens on a windy day.    however, that thought quickly left as i continued photographing.  the shape and structure of this thing was not at all like a trash bag or other paper or plastic trash.  it appeared to be box-like to some extent or it seemed more rigid than a bag would be blowing in the wind.  it also tumbled as it flew past and onward and dove occasionally but not very far or for very long.  the entire time it flew it was actually escalating in altitude.\n\ni managed to shoot about six shots that afternoon and towards the end of my encounter i shot about 15 seconds or so of video using the mpeg setting on my still camera.  reviewing my shots on my camera\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds lcd i was excited that i had managed to capture something that was clearly unusual at a minimum and potentially monumental on the far side of that equation.  i had captured it seemed a low flying alien craft that was no more than 200 feet off the ground and if it wasn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt alien in origin it certainly had to be some sort of secret governmental drone device.  but as i stated earlier i was expected at a friends house in the neighboring town and i was already late so i left my things alone and went off till early evening to do something else.\n\nwhen i got back i put my card in the card reader and extracted the photos that i had taken earlier.  as i was able to blow up the photos i took extremely closely i was shocked at what i saw.  the photos that i had the good fortune to capture earlier that afternoon were not of any debris or trash flying in the sky.  that is clearly the case as even if a case could be made for that as the object in the photos there was barely any wind that day at all.  a slight breeze of 5mph was what was recorded for saturday.  that was not enough wind to carry around anything let alone catapult a large squarely shaped trash bag ever upward.  i was mistaken earlier that was for certain in describing the object as some sort of craft or ship. it was not.\n\nthe photos reveal that what i saw and photographed that day was a living being; seemingly as alive as me or you and he was clearly not from here.  the being in the sky that i photographed had an amphibian or reptile-like appearance with a very large mushroom shaped head, large eyes and a large mouth.  his head was disproportionately larger than his body which i saw clearly was comprised of a pair of legs and arms.  his back seemed to be sheathed, resembling an armadillo of sorts and as the pictures indicate he is capable of enfolding himphotos.Self into himself potentially for protection or possibly navigation.  in his left hand he held what must be a wand or stick with a very bright light ball at the end.  finally, this creature had a tail that was visible and pointed downward even when he was folded into his sheath as you can see in the later", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/42146_submitter_file1__IMG18774.fw1640x421.jpg",

out the window, and saw two bright lights appearing to be underneath a street light across the way. when i locked on to it, it appeared to then \"level off\" and fly away into the distance in a slight curve around the pole, the lights on when to the right of the pole, off when to the left of it and fading to the distance. it didn't head all the way left as the airplanes do that land at the airport. it especially caught my eye because it looked similar to two white lights i saw in that same direction last june and posted to mufon. these lights were not clearly unconventional, but an hour later, taking in groceries from the car to the house, hovering directly across the cross street were two bright lights that were stationary, with a helicopter flying underneath it. the helicopter could be heard, the \"plane\" never made a sound. after i looked at it for a few seconds just hovering there and the helicopter moving beneath it, another light appeared to the right and the object started to \"glide\" away in that direction. a red light then appeared and flashed in a non-discernible pattern. i watched the triangle of white lights with a red light in its middle slowly move away and the helicopter followed it. i could clearly hear the helicopter and no other sound but traffic when it passed close by. ironically, or synchronistically, the june sighting already mentioned also included a triangle that flew over my house a short while after i had seen the object or objects with two white spheres. also, this monday night, my friend at my house and i heard rumbling off and on throughout the evening. after the sighting it got loud enough that we could feel the rumbling indoors and went outdoors to investigate. in the direction that the triangle object was hovering in when i initially saw it, it sounded as if jet engines were rumbling during takeoff when hearing that as an observer close to the ground by an airport when the planes take off. i doubt they were jet engines because the sound would usually build up then suddenly stop as if the engines were literally shut off, but if a plane were making the sound it should have faded away. the lights and sounds monday night were strange. i've included two images i created from pictures i've taken of areas in which i saw the lights from the perspective i saw them, \"photoshopping\" in the anomalous craft, lights and

saw coming from the west a solid, round and pure light about the size of a small basketball.  at first, i thought that it might be a plane; however, this also looked very similar to what i saw back in april of 2003.  thinking that maybe it was just a plane but possibly that ball of light, i continue to watch it.   i first spotted it about a mile or two away from me. it was at an altitude of about 100 feet.  it was still twilights (stars could still be seen) and the sun was still below the horizon. i kept watching that the ball of light thinking. \"my how familiar that looks.  probably plane's light?\"  i kept looking to see if there was any change in the light such as flickering, and i was listening for any kind of sounds of a plane, but i didn't hear no sounds.  just when the ball of light was just upon me of almost 100 feet away, i realize that this was no plane or  jet except only one thing, and one thing only!  it was that ball of light that i saw back in april of 2003! the first thing i thought, \"now here is my chance to get that picture of that ball of light which i couldn't get back in april 2003, and to see finally what that ball of light really is by zooming on it with the 300mm adjustable telescopic lens. maybe there some structure in it or around it that i can't see with just my eyes.\"  i ran inside the house, grabbed my camera, check the settings on the camera to make sure it was on night mode, then i ran back outside onto my porch. then i zoomed onto the ball of light,  and i focus the lens manually, then i began taking pictures.  i wanted to get every possible pictures i could get until i could no longer see the ball of light, or until i was no longer able to follow it.  i took many pictures from the porch until the ball of light object started to get out of my view because of tree branches.  i then ran through the house with my camera still in hand.  i came to spot in the middle of a sidewalk, and i began taking many closes up pictures, and i zoomed out once or twice for size comparison.  thankfully, there was enough light out during the dawn hours which i was hoping that the shutter wouldn't take too long to close.  but at the time, i thinking the shutter was taking to long to close.  i wanted a whole bunch of pictures, but the camera was just taking too long for  each picture shot.  there was a couple of times when a tree branch was almost blocking a clear shot of it, so i move over slightly to a different spot in order to get a clear shot of the ball of light.  i just kept taking pictures hoping i was focusing the lens clearly so the pictures wouldn't turn out  fuzzy.  i was also thinking , \"do i have enough time to set up the tripod?\"  i quickly decided against that idea.  i was also going to use the auto-focus, but i decided against that because it is unreliable in a quick situation which it takes up valuable time. [from camera experience taking pictures at night.]  any pictures of that ball of light ufo was better than no pictures, and i wanted all the pictures of it as i could possibly get of it. eventually,  a big tree got in the way of me seeing it, and it seem that the ball of light was just getting dimmer and dimmer as it travel away from me (smaller in size too.)  possibly, because of the direction the ball of light took was near in direction where the sun would eventually come up.  i moved over to a spot where i thought where it might pass through an open area to view it which the ball of light should not had taken too long for it to reach that area.  but i never did see it after waiting for it about a minute.  at that moment, i thought \"maybe it was getting too dim, and that's the reason i can't see it.\"  then i thought, \"well, maybe i could see it on the computer if there was any light still being emit by the ball of light. \"  so i took 3 more pictures, but i still didn't see that ball of light once it went behind that tree.  i then thought, \"maybe it instantly disappeared like that first ball of light. [april of 2003].\"  i went back inside the apartment, and i looked at the clock to see what time it was, then i noted that time down.  i saw my compass laying on the desk, so i decided to take a compass bearing of that ball of light route which was at 45 degrees of 360 degrees (almost north east).  this ball of light that was seen in mesa, arizona is identical to the ball of light i seen in pensacola, fl back in 2003. identical in shape, in light, in speed, and in altitude.  identical. this observation i just had was much closer than the first observation back in 2003 which i filed a report to nuforc back then.  i had a really good look of it. i saw no out lines of any structure for a ball of light to be attached.  it was simply a ball of light very similar to a globe.  unquestionably, it definitely look like it was a solid sphere, not just a light.  it almost seem like i could almost reach out and touch it; being, it was that close.  it was actually awe inspiring to observe this little ball of light just silently and slowly traversing through the air with it being bright yet gentle enough as to a soft glow to allow me to intensely gaze at it for every little hints of details that it may have for me to see.\n \n  since 2003, i been searching on the internet for any logical explanation of what that ball of light may be.  in the past week, i seen maybe several ufo objects, but i started to discount them as being ufos. then last night when i was watching 1 video on youtube showing ancient ufos depiction,  i was giving reason to every depictions why they were not ufos since it could also be intercepted in a different way.  now this may sound a little odd, but i was actually going to start thereafter showing some of my pictures on youtube.  pictures i took over the years, and give reasons why some pictures that other people took may be just birds, or planes, or whatever because there was a logical phenomenal reason for each one, and how some other people's photo may have these kinds of phenomenal occurrences in their pictures.  in another words, i turned on my views to that of  ufos were not real because i didn't see any real hard evidence except for only pictures as possible proof.  and maybe what i saw back 2003 was just something of a fluke created by the  military with their new invention or contraptions.  however, this morning,  i awoke up from a dead sleep at 5:00am which i normally don't get up that early.   i figured, since i up, i make some coffee, then i just go outside to drinks some coffee and smoke a cigarette.  i was probably no more than a couple minutes outside when i saw this ball of light.  now this all sounds very incidental, but i was going agree with some of those people out there that ufos are not real, but this morning quite literally and instantly reminded me again about the facts that  ufos are indeed real.  no questions or doubt about that; they undeniably and truly do indeed exist.  i have pictures of that ball of light now, unquestionably those pictures shows somewhat as evidence as to the  fact that there are ufos possibly extraterrestrial in origin.  and there is very good chance that somebody saw that same ufo too in the phoenix area this morning.  the question is: are they going to come forward maybe onto this site to say, they saw it too.", "photos":

station's escalators, as this was after the \"2000\" celebration on the national mall.  one friend was with me, but did not see the ufos.  at first i was not really watching the sky, but saw out of the corner of my eye what i \"thought\" was a shooting star (but it would have to have been a really big shooting star!).  i even said something to my friend, who wasn't really paying attention.  so now i was watching the skies while very slowly moving from the street to the top of the escalators.  that's when i started to see these very strange looking objects fly over downtown.  i estimate i saw a total of about 8 objects; i saw 2 groups of 2 objects each flying very close together, but the others were \"by themselves\", although all 8 or so objects were flying in a straight line, one after another.  several seconds would elapse between one object and another (or pair of objects).  i assume they were cylindrical shaped based on the peculiar lighting i saw.  they all appeared the same.  after \"seeing\" the \"shooting star\" (which most likely was one of these objects), the first i truly saw must have been two of these objects very close to each other (which looked even stranger); after seeing a few not flying so close, i determined that they were all this cylindrical shape, rather than 2 shapes.  they flew from a wnw direction to a ese direction, almost directly above where i was at the time (slightly south of my position), and i estimate that their trajectory, if unchanged, would have had them pass over the white house and the us capitol.  no turns, no curves, no change in altitude...Just a straight flyover, horizon to horizon.  i had much more of a western horizon than an eastern horizon, as there was some park-like space beyond the escalators to the west, but 12-story buildings elsewhere, including to my east; therefore i saw them approach more than i saw them depart.  i noticed no typical aircraft noise at all; however, it was a very noisy crowd i was in at the time...But the altitude of these seemed low enough that if they were conventional aircraft, some noise should have been noticed in spite of the crowd.\n\ni was quite stunned throughout the event.  it is the most unusual thing(s) i have ever seen in the sky (unless i saw some in my early childhood, which is possible).  i only said, and not loudly, at one point during the flyover, \"am i seeing ufos?\"  my friend was not paying attention at all, but a bystander, a young man, just glanced at me and smiled politely.  i did not notice anyone else observing these, but i wasn't really paying attention to the people around me at this time...In fact, i found myself suddenly at the top of the escalator.  i wish i would have turned around and stayed longer to see if i could see more of these, but i was surrounded (the crowd was like sardines) and the only way seemed to be \"down\" at that point, so i and my friend entered the station like everyone else.  \n\nit occurred to me that i had seen something very unusual and significant.  i had a \"semi-belief\" in extraterrestrial life and ufos prior to this, but this was just entertaining speculation.  this event changed all of that.  now i was \"one of them\"....One of \"those people\" who have seen such things.  so, in a way, it seemed like an \"initiation\".  certainly a \"paradigm shift\", and made a believer out of me for certain.  i told my friend after we got seated on a metro train about what i saw, asked her if she saw them.  she said she did not, and she gave me a \"funny\" smiling look, like she was trying not to laugh.\n\ni will attach a powerpoint presentation that made, which i presented last december at the colorado mufon meeting and holiday potluck.  john schuessler of int'l mufon was present as well.  i will also attach a shorter one about a sighting i heard about around 1997, from a friend who worked at the cia (langley).", "photos":

but it didn't move, and that's what got my attention.\n\nit was probably a few blocks away from me, but hanging right above my street.\n\nit was a row of strobing lights, tilted at about 25 or 30 degrees.  the lights strobed very fast, from left to right, emerging from around the side of the object, and disappearing around the other side.  they were mostly white and red, with a few blue strobes near the middle of the object.\n\nthe way the lights disappeared made the object appear to be either circular or triangular shaped.\n\nit hung in the air silently for about one minute after i noticed it.  it was still hovering when i ran inside to try and get it on camera.  (i did what i could, but i used the video setting of my digital camera, and it came out very dark, and i don't have the technology to lighten it.)\n\nafter i returned, and tried to film it, it began to slowly move southward, down my street it seemed, and then curved to the southeast, out of my view.\n\nit frightened me when i first saw it.  really scared me.  it took awhile for me to realize i could capture it on film.  when i got my camera, i fumbled it around a lot.  i was shaken.\n\ni know it was not a plane.  two planes flew by later, following their normal east to west, or west to east paths that i see all day.\n\nthis object was very low in the sky.  probably less than 500 feet above the ground.  it was close enough that i should have heard some sound from an engine.\n\nit was also huge.  i can't say how big, but from one end of the strobing lights to the other, it was far bigger than any plane i've seen.  i'm even familiar with the sight of c-130's flying at night, having lived for two years at the marine military academy, right next door to the confederate air force, and an airport that allowed c-130's to practice touching down and lifting off.\n\nthis object had a solid row of strobing lights that moved in one direction.  i've seen no plane look like that before.  it was not a plane.  it was also not a helicopter.  \n\nthe only thing it could have been, besides being an unknown craft, is a blimp.  actually, come to think of it, it couldn't have been even that.  a blimp would have blocked out the sky above the lights, and that was not the case.\n\ni'll attach the films, perhaps you can clean them up.  the second film is the longest.  the strong row of lights you see are streetlamps.  please remember, i was very shaken when i took these, and it's a crappy digital camera recording.  thanks for all your diligent work in taking these reports.\n\n~~kevin", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/4010_submitter_file1__ufo_sketch1.jpg",

an ideally clear and otherwise hot summer afternoon.  \nin the final seconds of darkness, my husband asked why i had not taken a photo with my cell phone.  frankly, it had not occurred to me.  knowing there were only seconds to spare, i grabbed my cell phone and took a picture of the brilliant eclipsed sun.  however, i knew that a cell phone photo could not capture the spectacular and rare occurrence we were graced with witnessing that day.   \nseveral weeks later, i thought about the picture i had taken on that special afternoon.  i checked my cell phone and zoomed in on the sun.  as i remembered it from that day, the moon had overtaken the sun and had become engulfed with an angelic-like flowing translucence; but the photo could not compare with the memory of the actual event.  before closing the picture, i glanced above and below to see if any of the visible planets or stars could be seen.  much to my surprise, i found an object of enormous size (in my zoomed-in frame) in the 6:00 position below the sun.  it was clearly not one of the visible planets or stars (based on location).  and since it had been so quiet that day, i knew it could not have been an airplane.  \nbefore that moment, i had been a sceptic.  but coincidentally (if there are coincidences), around the same period of time, i watched a new netflix release: unacknowledged.  my skepticism turned to avid curiosity.  and since that day, i have been doing my research. i believe that what appeared on my photo during the great american solar eclipse might be evidence of something else: one of ours or one of theirs.  i would be most interested in your opinion.  thank you.\nattachment: below", "photos":

the hill, we were  facing north north west comming down the hill. i am avid aviation enthusiast so i am familiar with the silhouettes of commerical, military, and civilan, aircraft these object resembled none of the known aircraft. i observed the objects which were equally spaced in a tandem bank to what would be their port sides. the craft then disappeared into the sky which was very overcast at the time but their \"glow\" could still be faintly seen, when they reappeared about two to 3 seconds later there was only four  and they were in pairs one pair was noticeably higher in altitude and to the left (our perspective) of the other pair. the craft then separated into the clouds individually for about two-three seconds again, when they emerged from the clouds again the fifth had rejoined the formation and they were in a tandem bank to their starboard sides again equally spaced between each other, the continued the bank until their formation was heading west (the formation for both banks was a column) the craft then went into a vertical climb at a very steep angle and at a high rate of speed and disappeared into the clouds again. they reappeared 4 seconds later in a delta formation and were banking to their port sides again, they broke formation and stacked themselves vertically in the center of the sky and hovered for about 25-30 seconds just pulsating, the upper four craft then \"slid\" down at the same time until the five were level with the horizon and then started another vertical but more gradual climb and proceed to do a \"continuous\" loop this lasted for 4 seconds they they broke off and i lost them in the clouds. when i reached the bottom of the hill i saw them for the last time before i turned west and caught a glimpse at the craft they were a \"sting-ray\" shape but were completely smooth, they also looked to be surrounded by a \"haze\" i last observed them heading northwest three were in the rear and abreast of each other with two leading abreast of each other, the outer most one of the \"three\" broke formation and slid up under and to the right of the leading two while the two in the rear climbed slightly above the leading three. throught this sighting the craft always maintained vertical and horizontal separation the distance between the craft was consistently equal there was also no sound that was accompaning any of this i lost sight of them in the clouds.\n  my reaction to this was i could not believe what i was seeing and was bothered that for the life of me i could not identify what i was witnessing. when i first saw these objects i thought it might have been birds but after observing the first \"maneuver\" i ruled that out. i was actually mesmorized when i saw it i was excited and scared at the same time. a cessna 172 flew over about 3 minutes later and my friend who has no interest in aviation looked up and said \"now thats an airplane.\" i also filed a report with the national ufo reporting center. i just figured the more people who knew the better chance i might have of getting what i saw confirmed.", "photos":

been observing pleiades cluster through telescope (i am an amateur astronomer). i was taking a break from observing for a minute. i looked up at the sky (i believe i was considering what to point the telescope at next.) there seemed to be a black object moving against the background of stars. it was difficult to see, but it appeared to have a round outline. there seemed to be something like a crescent / semi-circular arc of cloudy white vapor near the forward edge of the object. the vapor was faintly illuminated. it was very difficult to judge size or distance to the object.\n  i think my first thought was that the object was a cloud, but it was moving too fast, moving against what little wind there was, and had too regular a shape. i assumed that if i kept watching it, i'd be able to figure out what it was.\n  it was moving too fast for me to train my telescope on it. (went from about 75 degrees above the horizon to about 15 degrees above the horizon in about 60 seconds.)\n  the object appeared black or possibly transparent. almost like a lens that was distorting the images of the stars behind it. \n  the object appeared to hold a steady course and speed towards the north-west, moving much like a jet aircraft as far as i could tell. i moved my position by about ten feet while watching it to try to get a clearer view (there was one small, leafless tree obscuring). \n  i lost sight of the object when a car drove through the neighborhood and the car headlights (pointed almost straight at me) made it very difficult to see anything else. after the car left, i was not longer able to see the object which had been nearing the point where it would have been obscured by nearby houses and trees in any case.\n  i saw a jet airliner a few moments later. the jet followed a path approximately perpendicular to that of the 'object' and about 35 degrees above the western horizon. i saw no indication that the jet was aware of the other object.\n the sight of the jet did give me a good reference for comparison. the object had seemed to move at approximately the same angular speed as the jet. if i assume that the object was moving at the same speed and at the same altitude (which i know is a lot to assume), then it would have been immense: a diameter at least 3 times the length of the 727 that passed through about 60 seconds later.\nthe sky was clear with excellent visibility. there were no clouds. the temperature was around 40 fahrenheit.\n  i would speculate that the object might have been some kind of stealth aircraft...Possibly a b2? it was very difficult to judge exact shape and size: basically i observed a black object against a black background. my impression was that the object was very large and basically circular, but i suppose it is possible that it could have been 'wing-shaped.' also, the object made no discernible sound (most air-traffic in this area is audible), and the \"crescent of white vapor\" at the leading edge was puzzling. also, there were no conventional aircraft lights of any kind on the object. we are only 20 miles from a major airport and 5 miles from a small airport. there is considerable air traffic at that hour of the night. it seems very odd that even a military aircraft would operate without running lights of any kind in this area. if the object was a b2, then it should have been close enough for engine noise to be easily discernible. i heard nothing.\n  after going into my house for a few minutes, i came back out to investigate several possible causes for what i saw (some kind of reflection? my own breath condensing somehow? some kind of spot light? a flock of birds somehow reflecting city lights? a drone? a blimp? a balloon?) none of these explanations seems to fit what i saw. it was too regular in outline for a flock of birds or a cloud. it was moving too fast for some of the other explanations, and it did not make any sound. also, a drone or other small object should have shown a much smaller angular size as it moved away from me. this object seemed to grow only slightly smaller as it moved towards the horizon, which would seem to indicate that it was at a considerable distance from me even when it was almost overhead.\n  i was calm both during and after the incident. even though it is st. patrick's day, i have not consumed any alcohol in over 24 hours. my major reaction was to think, \"i'm sure i can figure this out if i just think long enough.\" however, i have grown increasingly certain that no conventional explanation (that i can think of) completely fits what i observed. i wanted to post this while the memory is still fresh in my mind.\n  to me the identity of object remains unknown.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90837_submitter_file1__UnknownObject20180317.png"], "lat": "41.66879", "sighted_at":

thought it was the moon reflecting off the window, so i ask my husband to come look at the moon and asked him if he saw the orb. he laughed and said it is just a reflection on the window, but i was skeptical. so i went and got my phone (samsung galaxy 5) to take a picture. i took a couple with the flash through the window, to atleast get a pic of the beautiful moon. the orb moved around back and forth in a slow circular movement, and changed from white to red at times. two of the pictures you can not see my tree and it was right there about 15ft away, the pictures have some weird white dots that look almost like i was looking at the moon while i was in space. the orb is captured in almost all of 18 pictures that i took. thinking that i would try to get a good picture of the moon, i went to the back of the house, behind the garage, outside so there wouldn't be any light interference. as i was taking (flash off) pictures of the moon, through my phone i could see a white orb, that would change to red, white, red. then i went back inside to look at my pics, they were quite strange. the ones that look like their from space, i zoomed out to see what was on them.  i saw what i thought

summer's day, and my plan had been to take some photos, grab an ice-cream from the nearby cafe, walk out to the coastal path, and then return, before following the coastal walk back to the nearest village, oystermouth, to get a bus home. strange as this sounds, i suddenly got the sense that i shouldn't venture out onto the isolated coastal path alone. that could have been just the natural caution of a woman out walking alone, admittedly. but as i stood overlooking limeslade, taking my shots, i grew more and more uneasy, to the point where i felt quite desperate to leave the area. i blamed my discomfort on the heat of the day, and when the next bus arrived, around 17.15, i hopped aboard and returned to the city centre.\n\ni thought no more of it, until i uploaded my pics onto my pc that evening. one of the shots showed a bizarre, airborne object, which seemed to be flying over the sea. i considered this may have just been an insect or airborne seed, close to the camera.

was not a natural cloud in the nightsky, it was completely clear out.  as my disbelief turned to awe i continued to stare at the object as it glided over our position in complete silence, and i saw that within the cloudy substance that flowed from the front of the object to the rear, was a geometric boomerang shaped object, with sharp lines, as if drawn by a ruler, contrasting against the background.  the cloudy mist-like substance seemed to spring forth out of nothing from the front of the object, and trailed over the rest of the craft towards the rear.  and as we gazed on in amazement for what was probably at most, 10 seconds, it approached the tree filled horizon, and that coupled with our turn on the road, took it out of our view.    \n\nwe could not believe our eyes, and started cursing a myriad of profanities uttering our complete amazement at what the hell just happened, and what the hell we just saw.  \"b\" and \"c\" had looked up a bit later than \"k\" and i, and had failed to see the geometric boomerang shape within the cloudy substance, but they did see the cloudy mist, in an angular fashion, gliding across the sky in a straight line briskly.  it had absolutely no sound at all, no lights, and moved in a completely straight line, in a direction that i believe was north or northeast.  we have no idea how big it was, only that it looked extremely large.  when talking about it with \"k\" later he told me that he held his hand up to the sky afterwards, with his pinky finger and index finger extended outwards, the others tucked in, in a sort of devil's horn you might say, and he felt like the distance between the two fingers pointing outwards was a good approximation of the wingspan of the strange object in the sky.  this however, really does not solve the qustion of just how big it really was, rather it only makes the argument for it being rather large.  if it was close to us in the sky, it was still huge as all hell, and if it was even higher up in the sky, then its size is even larger, almost mind boggling large. \n\nthis story is written with all honesty and complete truth.  both \"k\" and i had always believed in the possibility of ufos, but had never seen or experienced anything like this in our lives.  after talking about it more and more, we both feel like this is an event that has changed our lives forever.  to us there is no question about it: this was a real ufo, and it was not of this earth.  there is absolutely nothing manmade out there, not the stealth bomber, or anything, that can match up to what we saw that night.  immediately the following day after seeing the object, i began to research online what sightings of ufos were out there that met the same description, and i came upon a sighting of a ufo seen over belville, texas, in september of 2009, case number 19343.  the article describing the ufo fit our description perfectly in almost every detail.  the way it was described to be moving, that at first it seemed to be a fast moving cloud, but not a cloud at all, the way it looked, and the way it glided across the sky in a straight line.  after reading this i knew that this was the exact same craft we saw, and that we were not alone in witnessing such a spectacular object. \n\ni will forever be changed by this.  let people judge me how they may, but i speak the truth.  this is what i saw, and i was not alone in seeing it.  something is out there.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22911_submitter_file1__UFO001.jpg"], "lat": "40.18466", "sighted_at":

out onto my roof to sneak a cigerette. after about 10 minutes we see a light far off, as it gradually gets closer we relize that the light is pointed at us. not only that, but it is actually some sort of spotlight, we literally looked behind us, and could see our shadows on the woods behind my house.\n\nas it gets closer, we can tell that its a triangle shape, unlike anything ive ever seen, with blue lights outlining the shape, and the spotlight coming from the center. the closer this thing got, the house seemed to shake with the noise that it made, yet no ones lights seemed to go on inside their house. \n\nby the time it got around 500 or so feet away it stopped, it was still tremendously loud, but it stopped moving, and just hovered. i was extremely scared as i didnt know what the hell it was, so i looked at my friend, as he stands up and literally pulls his pants down and moons the object. i swear to god, he puuled down his pants to it and slapped his ass yelling \"come on mother fucker\". \n\nas i watched this, i looked behind me again, just to make sure this thing was looking at us, and one again, our shadows were on trees, there was no mistaking that it was looking at us. as it started to move again, it was going directly above us, and just as soon as it did, the light went off, and it all noise stopped, literally, their was no noise, not crickets, not me, just dead silence.\n\nsuddenly, it took off behind the woods at a speed that i could only make out the lights of it, and not the shape, ive never seen anything go so fast. as soon as i could collect myself i asked him what the hell he did that for, and he told me that if he was going to be abducted (as he told me he thought he was) he was at least going to make a point while doing it.\n\nnow im not saying this was an alien object, as we do live several miles from wright patt airforce base, but what ever it was, it was nothing i had seen before or since (and no it was not a stealth bomber). \n\nmy

me a more defined visual of the object. however, the object seemed to be changing in shape. i felt as if my brain had a hard time grasping the true shape of the object. the object seemed to flatten out into an elliptical shape and even split in two at times, then coalesced in less than a second. once the flying object moved past the cloud, it dissipated. since it was st. patrick's day, we

times, it will fade out gradually and disappear completely, and then re-appear, sometimes getting larger in size. it basically sits in one spot, just \"hanging\" there in the air, moving slowly up and down, left and right, around and around, sometimes fast. it always seems pretty close. a lot closer than stars or airplanes. \nsometimes, right when you look at it, it will disappear, as if it knows your watching it and/or is playing around.\nit does not have any other lights on it, it is just one big ball of light. it hovers above the woods sometimes and sometimes in the fields, or the horizon.

little sister are the only other persons that i know of that have seen it. i'm sure other people around platteville have seen it, because of how often i see it, but i'm not sure.\nshe(they) has only just seen it recently though(mom,sis), january 30th, of 2010. we were on our way to shullsburg, wisconsin, taking my younger sister to a friends house. it was around 4pm, so it was still light out. i'm not sure which direction we were driving, but as always i was just kind of eyeing the skies and spotted it and pointed it out to her. i have told her about it before, and she has never doubted me but is the type to have to see something to believe it, and she couldn't explain it herself.  \n\nwe pretty much observed the object the whole time on the way to shullsburg, with it sometimes disappearing for a while. on our way back to platteville we only noticed it peeping out a few times until we got close, then it appeared, it was near our airport, and i noticed a plane or jet flying up towards it, climbing higher and starting to go faster and closer to it. me and my mom were both observing this as we were coming into platteville. when the jet/plane got right to it, the craft disappeared completely. the jet/plane then slowed down and descended, right then the craft re-appeared in the same spot. \nwe were both pretty stunned by this, and i was very excited because i've always heard of this type of sighting, when a jet or plane chases a ufo but have never seen it until now. \nthe ufo i see though, i have not really heard any similar type of ufo craft. not as bright and close, and fading away and re-appearing. i see it very often. what made me first notice the craft, 5-6 years ago, would just have been me watching the skies, as i have always had an affinity for ufo's. when i see the craft i don't feel frightened or any negative effects, they aren't here to do any harm, i do not believe. \nthe photo's i have included are of the craft. \nthis is what happened

quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  at first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  it was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. it was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that i could hear.   as it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  it was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. there was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions had a very faint glowing quality to them.  as it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  it looked completely flat like it was a projection.  it began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. the total event lasted around 8 seconds.\ni have my master\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds degree in physics

possible that i was seeing a \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdsecret aircraft\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, i am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  i would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though i could be way off.   once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. the measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  it all happened very fast and was short in duration, making it difficult to be definite on measurements.  all in all, i saw a craft without doubt and i am perplexed by what i have seen.", "photos":

still clearly picture the event as if it happened yesterday.\n\nat the time, i was living in a rural area near the town i specified in the report.  we decided to go into town and buy dinner from a restaurant rather than cook something at home.  i was with one other person, who was driving the vehicle, as we went into town as we so often did.  it was late evening and the sun was going down.  our order at the restaurant took an abnormally long time to prepare, so by the time we were heading back home it was dark out and we could see the stars above us.\n\nwe were driving back home to the rural area where we lived when the event took place.  we were driving on the highway specified in the report, and up until the event our view of the sky to the southwest was obstructed by tall trees.  then as we took a turn and the area to our left opened up, we could see what looked at first to be like a very tall radio or cell tower.\n\nwe both remarked to each other that we didn't remember there being a tower out there, and that's just the thing, there wasn't and still is not a tower out there.  upon realizing this, we both began to observe the object(s) more closely.\n\nthe main thing that drew our attention was a large, unwavering and immobile orange light that, from our perspective, looked to be about the size of a circular tablet of aspirin.  behind it were three smaller white lights which seemed to be hovering in formation.  the fact that the lights weren't moving or flashing indicated to us that we weren't simply seeing airplanes in the sky, and that was why we thought it was just a very tall aerial tower at first.\n\nwe observed the lights for at least five minutes as we drove on the highway, but because someone was rudely tailgating us we were not able to pull off to the shoulder and take pictures or a video.  this is the one part that i can't exactly remember; whether or not we were able to see the stars in-between the formation of lights, so i'm not sure if they were four separate objects, or if they were lights on one single craft.\n\nif it was one craft, it would have to have been absolutely massive.  the formation of the four lights made the shape of an almost triangular rhombus.  we both knew that we were seeing something strange, and although i can't speak for the other witness, i felt a sense of dread and anxiety, as if i wasn't supposed to be looking.  when we got home we talked about the odd experience for a short while before going to bed, and essentially forgot about the experience.\n\ni spoke with the other witness before making this report to verify what we had seen, and it seemed like he hadn't really thought about the experience again until i reminded him of it just tonight.  i've thought about it a few times over the years but never felt compelled to report the sighting until now.\n\nwe lost sight of the lights when we turned off of the highway on our way back home.  due to the amount of trees in the area it would have been impossible to observe the lights from where we lived.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90300_submitter_file1__fotonoexif.jpg"], "lat": "35.24361", "sighted_at": "2012-02-29"},

for my dog.  i looked up and saw a gray reflective horseshoe shape object about 100 feet above me.  the object moved very slowly and seemed to disappear into the night, it was very dark gary, sort of reflecting, but hard to tell due to the night sky.  i had been reading this book and had a pen in my pocket and drew it in my book as i stood there. at first, i was stunned, was it my imagination?  i looked harder, i did not see it approaching me, it was just there and then moved slowly over me, very slowly and i was astonished it was so low to the ground.  i knew it was not like anything i had seen before, i live about 15 miles from will rogers intl airport.  but it wasn't a flight path normally used.  it seemed to be crawling over my head over the edge of the house and where i was standing about 10 feet from the porch.  i thought maybe it was a blimp, but did not have that shape, the horseshoe shape was clearly defined as was the two round fan shapped objects at the end of each side of the horseshoe that i seemed to be able to see thru.  as it was going slowly, over me i could see the sky thru the vent things.  the reflective surface was gray but the edges were sort of fuzzy, it seemed to reflect my house lights.  i brought it up at a mufon meeting a month later (i am a member) that 2 other people (also mufon members-a couple) had seen it the same night and and agreed that my picture i drew in the book was accurate.  i believe them because, while we were discussing things at the meeting, prior to my mentioning it, i showed the drawing to a the wife member sitting next to me.  she stated she had seen that and asked me to show her husband was standing at the back of the room.  i did and they both discussed the date, i had not told them the date yet, and they confirmed my date.  i believe they said there were others with them when they saw it.  i reported this out loud to the group with the dirctor there.  it is not like anything i have seen before, 200 feet long  and 50 feet wide with a chunk out of the center about 1/3 of the way in from the end that gave it a horseshoe look.  at the tip of each horseshoe was a round fan with blades (or thats how i perceived it) that i could see through to the night sky.  i had enough time to draw it as it moved over my head, about 2 minutes. i looked up after drawing it one more time and good not see it any longer.  in my excitement, i did not notice  if it made noise that i could hear at the time, but upon memory i could swear it made a very quiet humming noise.  i am submitting this as a mufon member of my own accord, no one had prompted me at the time to record this event. maybe it is an ifo because the state director at the time did not ask me to report it or do an interview to document the event, he did not approach the other couple either that i know of.  by the way the other couple was in tulsa area, i am in mustang, just west of oklahoma city.  that is a very long distance, over 120 miles away seen on the same night by me a mufon member and them also mufon members, what's the chance of that!    i do have several other sightings  to record.  maybe they are not ufo's.  military maybe but not like anything i have seen.  but that's what i (we) saw.  i showed the drawing to 2 family members who work in aviation navigation and also military air traffic control and it was unfamiliar to them.  i will notify our new state dirctor that i filed this report.  i originally drew it with pen, but after trying to make a picture of it by hand, i decided to see if i could get the image of the surface to show on a paint program.  this is very close to what i saw.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22259_submitter_file1__7-25-09.jpg"], "lat": "35.39178", "sighted_at":

wondering what the hell it was?! after about 30 seconds of this it turned abruptly upward and vanished without a trace like it was swallowed up by the night sky. it didn't look solid at all like it

and so i'm used to seeing all kinds of civilian and military aircraft which this was nothing like this. there was no lights on it but updated as if it was just made of pure light, it moved at impossible angles and was too fast to be man made. it wasn't a meteor either because rather than fall to the earth it moved back upward towards space before disappearing and was moving too closely

activity among other unknown reasons.When i see these aircraft with chemtrails..I always make it a point to look for ufos and many,many times i have seen \"spheres\" which always take on the color of their surroundings..If they are in or near clouds they will appear white and if they are in the clear blue sky they will appear transparent but discernible if you continue to look closely enough..\n\nby doing this i have led a few people to see these craft when they otherwise didn't even believe in ufos..\n\ni have witnessed ufo activity several times with the chemtrail phenomenon and this time i was armed with a camera.\n\ni didn't see anything like i normally had previously but i did notice a faint object the shape of a \"bell\" directly above which seemed to be out of the path of these aircraft's pattern..I grabbed a pair of 10x binoculars and i picked up on the object so i pointed my camera in that general direction and started snapping images and i was able to capture a triangle/bell shaped object.It was stationary for several minutes before disappearing. i started to go inside and i felt like i should stay out for a few minutes more..That i hadn't seen enough and that if i went inside i would miss the craft if it returned or appeared in another part of the sky..\n\nfinally after about 3-4 minutes,i thought it was over when i began to get an feeling of being watched and i heard in my mind \" turn around and look at me\" and i caught it just before it disappeared..It is beyond my ability to understand...But i believe with all of my heart.. i was basically told \n\n\"hello,here i am!!\" like i was a participant in a game of \"hide and seek\"\n\nthis is not the first time i have been absolutely \"compelled\" to look at a direct spot in the sky and had a ufo sighting..\n\nso i just i started snapping pictures indiscriminately and that is when i captured the faint sphere when i pointed my eyes in the certain point in the sky..\n\ni have seen several ufos while watching the chemtrail activity in this area..I live in the appalachia mountains directly on a mountain top that is part of a state park with one part being very high bluff which overlooks the major city in this area and it has been a perfect spot to watch much aeronautical activity..Including lots ufos.\n\ni only recently purchased a camera..But i have seen many,many ufos since being in this area..\n\nthese are only the images i have of this report..I have a few others but these were the first since i began filming and they were daylight captures..\n\nthe first image is a copy of the original and the second is a copy of the image with different color filters which bring out the craft from the background color of the sky..\n\nthe third image is of the craft that appeared and in my mind i was compelled to look and there it was observing me..It wanted me to see it!..Otherwise i would have continued looking in the other direction..\n\nthey have not been altered and are real..\n\ni had to turn nearly 180 degrees to catch the craft in the third image after it compelled me to look in that direction..\n\ni offer a little info about my background..I have held a high level security clearance for the dod and worked in intelligence with one of america's top tier defense contractors and i used to be a deputy sheriff.\n\ni need to know why this is happening..\n\nthis event happened just like reported..There are many more and i think there is a reason for them..I am hoping to find out why!!..Maybe you can help me..", "photos":

and white light were alternating blinks. i could see the outline of it, and it was definitely a triangular shape. after researching a little the only thing i found is a tr-3b or a b-2. it's just very unusual timing, and we've never had anything like this fly over before. we've actually seen some larger fighter jets fly over during the day once or twice, but nothing like this. and i'm not too sure

well) but the object had moved so far south and gained altitude that you can only see a dim round bluish light. my wife said she saw what appeared to be wings that were retracted into the sphere then

moving and the absence of wings, a tail or markings or sound. i noticed a couple of other people staring at it too. we followed it for maybe a minute and a half and it eventually faded from sight to

another school.  i had thirty minutes before the second school students were released, and it would only take seven or eight minutes to get there.  i was proceeding eastbound on e. contessa street in the residential area just northwest of the intersection of n. greenfield road and e. university drive when i noticed a black object or spot in the air due north of my location.  it appeared to be in the climb-out path of runway 22 of falcon field airport.  i stopped my bus in the intersection of e. contessa street and n. orlando for a better look, and determined that the object was stationary in the sky at approximately a 25 or 30-degree angle above the horizon.  it was featureless black and mostly round, though the edges were not sharply defined in my eyes.  (note:  i have a slight double-vision problem; traffic light one or two blocks away appear to be two lights side-by-side; aircraft in flight appear to have two wings or two fuselages depending on the angle at which they appear from my position.)  i could not see the double-vision effect in this case, however -- the edges of the object just appeared to be poorly defined.)  i considered the possibility that this was an inflated black garbage bag floating around and changing shape slightly, but it seemed to be locked solidly in one position, unmoving, and was too black -- i.E., it was much blacker than a distant black object should have been given the intervening hazy atmosphere.  (also, the weather was a high thin overcast.)  i continued on to n. greenfield road and turned left, or northbound.  as i drove northbound a light aircraft was observed climbing out of falcon field from my right to left and it passed apparently between me and the object, though it did not pass directly in front of the object.  the aircraft then made a climbing turn to the right, apparently passing to the west of the object.  i don't know if the pilot saw the object or not.  at the time i was monitoring 124.6-mhz, the control tower frequency of falcon field (i am a student pilot), and while i was not paying a lot of attention to the radio traffic i did not hear any excited transmissions or anything indicating the control tower personnel was aware of the object.  as i drove north at 45 mph there was an optical illusion of the object seeming to get lower on the horizon as though it was moving away from me faster than i was approaching it.  yet, when i stopped for traffic lights, the object was still unmoving and still at 25 to 30-degrees above the horizone, and had not gotten any smaller or larger, and did not appear any closer or farther away.  however, it had seemingly moved slightly to the west, so it was now north-northwest of me.  the angle above the horizon, and its size, and it degree of blackness did not change as i traveled three miles north from where i originally saw it -- in other words, i did not appear to be getting any closer to it; i was not getting under it, it's position relative to me seemed unchanging in all respects.  at one point i saw a woman standing on the curb on the east side of greenfield with a cellphone to her ear, and she was looking in the general direction of the object, but i don't know if she was looking at the object.  the intersection of n. greenfield road and e. mcdowell road was the three mile point from where i started, and as i drove the last half mile or so from there to the 202 freeway, the object did move further to the west and began to get smaller.  when i turned east on the 202 the object was north-northwest of me and getting significantly smaller.  as i proceeded east on the 202 i looked back over my left shoulder and lost sight of it as the freeway dipped into a trench, but when the freeway climbed out of the trench again i caught a glimpse over my shoulder of a very tiny black dot in the distant north-northwest.  a possibility, though i seriously doubt it:  mcdonnell-douglas manufactures the apache helicopter on the north side of falcon field and it is not unusual to see dark olive-drab and other helicopters flying patterns in the area.  it could be claimed that the object i saw was a helicopter.  i seriously doubt it, however, because 1:  i never saw any flickering of rotor blades; 2:  it was stationary at all times when i stopped at three different traffic lights, yet i never got any closer to it and the angle above the horizon never changed even as the azimuth changed more and more toward the west after i crossed mcdowell.\np.S.  i was a field investigator for apro in the 1970's in australia, but the last case i paid any attention to was the travis walton abduction case after i returned to the u.S.  this sighting generated in me the same feelings that caused me to eventually give up on ufo sightings:  most of them didn't make any sense:  even extraterrestrial spacecraft couldn't do what many sightings reported if they had any physicality at all.  this was more like a hole into our space from another dimension -- and that doesn't explain it either.  so, there it is, for whatever it is worth.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22049_submitter_file1__001_A_002_DonCline.mp3"], "lat": "33.42202", "sighted_at":

"dear mufon,\n    hello, i would like to share my experience of a very exciting incident which occurred two nights ago on november 17, 2015 in charleston, west virginia. it was almost 8 pm in the evening and was completely dark as i was leaving my mother's house. as i was getting into my car and talking to my mother who was standing next to the car i noticed object come into view behind her in the sky. i asked her what is that mother, she turned around and we both watched the object in amazement. it wasn't very far from us, perhaps 200 or 300 feet just above the treetops and above her roof. it looked like a glowing reddish orange orb. at first it looked like it had flames coming out of the bottom and the top part of it glowed extremely bright orange. it was moving rather quickly in a straight line from east to west against the wind. it did not appear to be a mechanical device although i am not sure because it did not look like anything i had ever seen. as it continued across the sky i pulled my cell phone out of my pocket and began to take pictures. of course as anyone knows who has tried to take pictures of stars or the moon at night, bright objects in the night sky appear much smaller than they  actually were in person. so the pictures appear to be a small orange object but in real life it was much bigger. if you enlarge the object in the picture you can clearly see the shape of the orb and it is very symmetrical. also when i first saw the object it was very close to me however before i could take pictures it had moved quite a distance away. the whole event probably only took about 15 to 20 seconds before it moved out of sight and moved over the mountains headed towards the river. the object made no noise at all and did not seem to be powered by anything that i could tell which resembled an engine or any other power source. at first i thought maybe it was a bag of garbage that had caught on fire and was floating. however it did not move vertically up, it moved horizontally from east to west and just kept on going until it was out of sight. i could not say for sure how big it was it appeared to be about 5 to 10 feet but that is just a guess. i have been thinking about it for two days and i still do not know what i saw. my mother thinks it could have been a drone of some sort, but this does not make sense to me because of the range of the distance it covered and i have never seen a drone that look like that. i have pictures i can download and send to you. i would be very curious to know if anybody else in my area saw this object and reported it to anyone two nights ago. thank you.\n\n                                                                             andrew chattin", "photos":

rarely fails me, family and friends can testify to this). for two minutes i looked around, to see if it was my neighbors or a cat. eventually i looked to the sky... nothing north... west... south... then i turned around sharply, i laid eyes directly east, on a cloud. the following happened intensly fast.\n\n i noticed something in the split second i had turned, i thought it was a star for a moment. i saw a bright circular object, it was pure white, mabye a hint of orange. my mind did not have enough time to register exact colors, and/or any other lights on it.\n\n then this object, less than a moment after i saw it, accelerated south, through a cloud, and on up into the atmosphere. it left a wake in the cloud. in about two seconds this object traveled from western zenith (directly behind and above me, aproximately 5,000 feet above me) to the southern horizon. i've lived most of my life in this heavily military used airspace (near eglin air force base) and i can promise you, nothing accelerates from 0 to well over mach 4 in less than two seconds. judging by the distances guessed by the cloud base, i estimate the object to be half the size of a boeing 747 liner.\n\n my first reaction was the fact that i had seen another ufo (this is the 3rd in my area, each was different than the last, some time inbetween them), then my second reation was... i was being watched. i paniced, ran inside. i did not want to stand out in the open night air. \n\n later i exited the safety of my home armed with my glock. nothing appeared this time. i refuse to leave my house at night without being armed now. not after being spied on by a craft...\n\n if you have any opinions on what i should do in the event of it returning or actually bothering me, please let me know.", "photos":

looking at something abnormal. i looked for red beacons or directional green/red lighting on the craft and observed none. i hold a certification in airplane mechanics and noticed this crafts light pattern was unusual. unfortunately the sky was dark and i was unable to see a defined outline of the craft, there were several pale white lights which appeared on the underside of the craft in the shape of a triangle. see attached sketch. it was quiet enough out to hear a dog barking several blocks away and i did not hear any sounds coming from the sky, i questioned if it could be a drone but it appeared too large for something you could buy, and it was windy out with a very light drizzle. unfavorable conditions for hobby flying. the craft seemed to be traveling at or just under cloud level to possibly maintain obscurity? appeared to have faster than normal movement compared to usual air traffic. craft made a sharp left hand pitch, then appeared to level off and move up into cloud cover. observation time was short approximately 10-15 seconds. she asked what that was, to which i replied i was not sure. she asked again a bit more seriously but neither of us were sure what we just saw.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90611_submitter_file1__Mar62018730PMSpringHill.png"], "lat": "28.52760", "sighted_at": "2018-03-06"}, "90613": {"reported_at": "2018-03-06",

was 3:58 am fri morning march 24, 2006.  i was outside in my driveway walking down to get the morning paper.  i looked up into the sky, casually gazing at the stars when a moving object caught my attention.  i wondered if i was looking at a satellite moving across the sky because it seemed to be too high to be a jet of some sort unless it was a military craft that flew at very high levels.  anyway i stopped walking and watched it.  about 5 to 10 seconds after i stopped to watch it, the object grew in brightness and remained really bright for about 3 seconds then faded back to where it was previously.  i chuckled and said to myself something like well if this is another ufo then it is acknowledging me that it knows i am watching it.  casually i watched it as it kept on moving off in a general south eastern flight path.  after about 3 minutes or so, i couldn't track it due to trees so i stopped watching and went on to get the paper and go back inside the house.", "photos":
