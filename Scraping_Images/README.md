Image Scraping

Things to be installed: 

1. Install selenium and the web drivers
	brew install selenium OR sudo easy_install selenium


Steps: 

1. Re-confirm what the base URL is.
2. Change the path to the chrome_extensions to where ever the folder is. 
3. Randomly chose the start and end ID for the url as the images are captured bases on the ID. Preferable to run on a small range for testing
4. Run the scraping_v2.py script

End Result: captured approximately 1800 images.
