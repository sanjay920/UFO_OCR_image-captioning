around 8:30 pm, i took my dogs outside and continued to watch over them. then, in the west corner of my yard, i spotted an eerily bright light, peeking through the trees. i walked towards it in order to take a closer look, and it seemed to me an obviously bizarre, horizontal crescent shape. on closer inspection it looked to be a solid oval shaped object, with its bottom half glowing. even though by instinct i knew it was not a normal light, i began to reason that it was probably a street light in the distance. the object at this point (to my view), was below the tree line. i then proceeded to disregard it for a whole 10 minutes while i was in the yard. lol, probably not the best idea. i did keep partial watch over it, though. i observed that it was completely still and silent. didn't move a centimeter from my view, and made absolutely no noise. even though it gave off a very bright light, the brightness seemed contained, so it didn't light up anything around it. after about ten minutes of walking and dancing (hey, i was bored) around the yard, i let my dogs back inside the house. i took my eyes off of the object for about 30 seconds while in my house. i was still very curious about this bright object so, i walked back outside and made a beeline to the area i saw it before. right then, i saw something above me, from the corner of my eye. i looked up, and while i wasn't looking the object had moved across half my yard and was now in the sky high up above the tree line. it was also much closer to me now. scared the hell out of me. it was even then very still, and emitted no noise. i pulled out my phone and took two pictures of it. the first turned out clear, but there seems to be another light in the picture, no idea what that is. also, even though to my eye the illuminated part of the object appeared to be crescent shaped, my phone picked it up to be a different shape. when i tried to take a second photo, the object on my screen turned to a full glowing circle, and then my whole phone screen lit up white. that photo came out black. i assumed it didn't want me to take pictures, and since i was also thoroughly freaked out(and alone), i rushed back inside. i checked after two minutes to see if it was gone. it was. i had no idea how large the object was, and had no reference points to gauge its distance from me. i think that it was possibly watching me, since it only moved when i briefly went inside.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90058_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg"], "lat": "29.55049", "sighted_at": "2017-12-24"},

inside the house to get the attention of my father, sister and  sisters fiance. when we came outside, the object had not moved far from where i  first observed it.  as we watched it, we  could tell it was starting to change  direction and it began to head in an easterly direction. the entire sky was clear with no clouds in sight, airplanes at various elevations we're seen clearly flying in multiple directions with no cloud cover, one aircraft flew behind it and we lost sight of the airplane due to the cloud and mission or haze around the object and then the airplane became visible again as a came out the other side but the airplane was much further away in distance. object seemed to be emitting it's own vertical bowtie shaped whitish glowing cloud that grew in size as it approached us, as it turned to the east the bowtie turned into a twin tail that continued to grow and widen, the brightest portion of the object seemed to be the point of the cloud as though it we're a jet breaking the sound barrier but moved too slowly with no sound at all. the object seems as though it was moving very slowly yet the cone shaped cloud it was emitting was getting larger and larger to what is guess to be a diameter of 500 ft almost instantaneously. the cloud grew from a twin tail to a full-blown cone shaped cloud in a matter of 10 to 15 seconds the object then seemed to turn more towards the east southeast and began to detach from the cloud and began to dim in brightness until it was completely out of sight and the cloud dissipated and completely disappeared within one to one and a half

checked into it more then.\n i was at white river bridge in paragon,in fishing and noticed the moon rise was photo worthy and took several pics of it.There are a few before the object appears and a few after but it's only noticeable in 2.The 2 i am sending were taken just a few seconds apart.It is just to the left in the 1st pic at about 9 o'clock.In the 2nd it looks to be behind the small white cloud at about 3 o'clock.The pics are quite a bit clearer on my tablet for whatever reason.But there is a dark shape like the object in the 1st pic obscured somewhat by the cloud.I have the time stamp with date and my location if you decide this is worth your time.Thanks,james harris", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/90099_submitter_file1__ufo1.jpg",
