quickly got to them, but they said it disappeared. they said it stayed hovered (in the distance) above the skyline and quickly disappeared. i was curious so i looked everywhere i could to find something similar to what they described. they described it as red, green and white flashes of light. all of a sudden, on my right hand side, i noticed something flashing, much brighter than all the other stars. it also flashed red, green, and white light. it stayed stationary for approximately 20 minutes before going in a pattern. the pattern was this: up, down, diagonally left, and then diagonally back to it's original spot. we then noticed 2 more, side by side, close to the star betelgeuse following the same pattern of movement and had the same flashing lights. eventually the original one i spotted began to drop, slowly, below the mountain, and then bobbed up and down, still visible. it then disappeared. the other two began to get more faint like they were farther away. then to the far left of me, one much closer appeared out of no where, also with the same pattern and colors. then out of nowhere it disappeared. the only two that were left were the two closest to betelgeuse. we sat and watched until approximately 4:30am. the two did not disappear. we left so i do not know what happened with those last two. i almost cried out of excitement, i never in my life thought i would experience something like this. i'm going back tonight with one of the friends who joined me last night, and another person who did not see them last night. we're going at the same

of venice, florida, for some skywatching.  ufo's are often reported in this southwest part of the state. the night\nwas clear, and for the first hour we saw nothing moving through the sky except planes and helicopters, both flashing lights and making plenty of motor noise.  about 8:31 we noticed a small cluster of lights moving together toward us from over the gulf -- completely silent with no lights flashing. as they they moved closer to the beach, a bright beam of light suddenly shot down from the group of moving lights, scanning a small area of shallow water offshore for only about 10 to 15 seconds. the cluster then passed over the beach about a quarter mile south of where we were, disappearing inland toward the east.\n  luckily i captured two photos, thinking that when i processed them in photoshop i'd see the lights connected to some outline of a plane or helicopter. the mysterious five lights are very small in the original raw\nimages, so i had to enlarge and crop the images quite a bit, lightening them overall and increasing the contrast to reveal stars against the dark sky.  although the lights are pixilated in these enlargements, it appears that they are not attached to a solid body of any kind (unless it is invisible.) between the five lights, there are stars shining from behind and through the areas where we might expect to see some indication of a fuselage or other structure supporting the lights.  what are your thoughts?  naturally, we are quite curious but not surprised, since all\nof have seen ufos before. (enlarge to 200% to see a bit more detail.)\n  in the data file of my camera, the attached file #1 was taken at 20:32:27, and file #2 was taken at 20:32:49. you can see in these two images that the lights moved in relation to background stars. for file #3,\ni exaggerated the contrast dramatically, still looking for some kind of\noutline of a solid body or structure to which the lights were attached --\nnothing seen.\n  if you would like to look at the original raw images, i can send them so you can see that no object in the photos was added, deleted, moved or altered in any way.  \n  my three friends can attest to witnessing this event.\n \nsincerely,\n \npete carmichael", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/23048_submitter_file1__1.UFOLIGHTSVENICE.TIF",

little to see it and i snapped one picture zoomed in as far as i could and it looked more long in the picture then with my eye then i switched my camera to video mode and started filming while the

a bar in huntington beach for a friends concert. i had dropped them off and continued north on my normal route home the streets were empty and i remember getting that feeling of anxiety or like when the hairs on your arms and back of your neck stand up, like something is about to take place that you would rather not have happen. i remember feeling tense because i was running into every red light although no one was on the road and i couldn't help but feel the sensation that like i was running from something or like as if i was being watched or chased. i remember feeling a small sense of relief every time i would pass another motorist or local seven-eleven, i even stopped to buy a pack of cigarettes although i had quit the month before i think i just needed the reassurance of the cash tender to make me snap out of whatever i was feeling but when i got back into my car i felt it again like an aura was surrounding me in my car. as i continued northbound i lit a cigarette at one stop sign when i saw the first flash, it was as though someone had taken a photo of the street from above, i initially shrugged it off as i was too focused on getting home. there was one more flash that seemed to be 20-30 feet ahead of my vehicle, thats when i looked up and saw what appeared like an arrow tip formation of lights changing colors, it looked as if it was traveling in the same direction as i as the tip of the arrow was pointing in my direction. at first i believed it to be a commercial aircraft or jetliner as we have many airplane traffic by john wayne airport so i tried to ignore it but i remember that the colors kept pulsating like a heart beat so i continued to follow it through my windshield. the formation was composed of perhaps 9-12 lights all at different variations of brightness, the tip was a crimson-red that pulsed to a tangerine-orange, the two rear lights were purple and would change to a light blue, and in between there were white and yellow dimly flickering lights. on this particular night i remember that the moon was not out and the sky was quite dark so i couldn't make out any solid structure they could have been attached to. i was still driving behind it waiting to see if it would fly further away or reveal a flight pattern but it would not move forward nor fall back, it was as though it was hovering at the same speed that i was traveling, and that is when i got the feeling of anxiety again except this time i felt like i was being watched. it would stay with me for about 4-5 miles and finally the leading light started to fall behind, still throbbing the same crimson pattern, it was as though it was changing formation. the white and yellow flickering lights were gone by now and the arrow was now pointing the opposite direction but continued before my vehicle until it began to travel in that direction. these lights were following me for approximately 10 minutes before they past over me, disappearing to my rear. i didn't look back or see exactly where they dissipated but i remember a terrible head ache, in fact when i finally got home and got out of my car i remember vomiting because my head hurt so bad. i wanted sleep really bad, my eyes felt like they were shutting and i couldn't control them thats when my girlfriend came to the door and found me laying in my own vomit, she asked if i was drunk but i explained to her that i had been sober for the later part of the night. i don't remember exactly what time i had arrived home but i saw the clock as i was explaining the incident to my girlfriend and the time was almost four, i remember thinking how could a twenty minute drive from my buddies house to mine prolong to an hour and a half. my girlfriend still doesn't know how long i was laying out on the front porch. this event sticks out in my memory because of the strong emotional feelings of anxiety and helplessness. i have only shared this experience with a select few including my girlfriend and they

cross, and had a mass of something at the junction of where the vertical and horizontal parts met. the object did not appear to be powered and was simply floating northbound. the object did not have

northbound).\n\ni had the object in sight until i turned left onto terex rd. i traveled approximately 1/4 mile on terex rd. and then made a u-turn heading back towards darrow rd. at that point i could

and tell me what he thought it was. we thought it was maybe an osprey, blimp or balloon- it was far away and difficult to tell it's shape. i even thought it was a trash bag.\n\nas the object came directly above our home, we were able to see the shape very clearly. the unidentifiable craft was a very large flying pyramid. it looked nearly identical to the pyramid of giza, except it had a tall antenna with 3 horizontal bars & two areas on the side that were indented.\n\nat that moment we realized it was a ufo. when i say \"ufo\", i don't mean an extraterrestrial craft, i mean that it was not a known craft that i have seen. the craft was flying at a very slow, steady speed in a strait line. it came from the south-west & kept going without pause to north-east. we watched it until we could no longer see it. the craft was brown in colour, had 4 sides & was flying fairly low, maybe 3-4 telephone poles up.\n\nwe saw this ufo on july 1st, 2007 at 7:25pm & watched it for approx. 5 mins. my dad and i were so busy analyzing the craft that i did not stop to think to get my camera! i'm still very upset that i didn't get my camera, it would have been a great picture too. this is not the first time i have seen ufos, but this particular sighting was the best one.\n\nwell, i attached a sketch of the \"flying pyramid\" (that's what i call this sighting). um, if i tell you about my

"I'm reluctant to post this but it's bothered me my entire life and i'm curious if anyone else has recorded or filmed a similar object.  my experience dates back to 1967 so its been a while.\n\none warm summer night around 10pm, with a clear sky and unlimited visability in lakewood washington, located approximately 3-4 miles nw of mcchord usaf base near tacoma i witnessed a very strange object close-up that also caused some physical reactions to myself and the surrounding yard where i was playing.\n\ni had planned to go bass fishing with my grandfather the next day and was practicing my casting in the back yard with my pool and a rubber weight.  the air had been extremely still, typical of summer nights in the region.  occassionally, depending on air traffic and winds, we were very close to the flight patterns for approach to mcchord air base and i always loved watching the c5's, b52's, phantoms and helicopters passing over the house at 1500-2000 feet on final.  normally they wouldn't pass over us at night because of sound constraints for the civilians but now and then they would.  i was very familar with all types of aircraft coming and going over the years both in daylight and night conditions. the sound of a c5 or b52 with full flaps on final at 1500ft can't be mistaken.\n\nthis event/sound was different.  as i stood in the back yard i heard a low multi-pitched hum i hadn't heard before.  knowing the flight line i looked to the northwest and waited for watever it was to come into view.  the property was fairly surrounded by fir trees of about 75 to 100' around the perimeter so i didn't have a line of sight to the horizon.  as the pitch grew closer & louder the surrounding trees started to sway but there was no wind.  then a triangular object appeared over the tree tops moving to the southeast toward mcchord usaf very slowly.\n\nthe object was at about 100-125 directly above me and barely cleared the trees.  it was triangular in shape with a large perhaps 25'diameter sphere in each corner which looked like glass glowing red to orange to yellow in a marble swirl patern.  the sound was very low frequency, perhaps less than 100hz with another at perhaps 500hz.  as it moved to the southeast it rotated clockwise slowly and made only a little over one rotation while in my sight for nearly 1.5 minutes in which time i'd guess it went 4-5 city blocks.  it took that long for it to move over the house and out of sight over the trees.\n\nthe superstructure between the spheres was a semi-dull metalic open framework with diagonal braces between two main stringers similar to a large metal structural building truss.  there was no platform of structure inside the perimeter of the framework and i could see thru the entire structure with the exception of the spheres in the corners.  it was nearly silent as it moved and the huming was at a level close to a moderate speaking level volume.\n\nas it flew over the trees moved violently without wind, my hair stood on end and i became light headed and a little sick to my stomack like motion sickness.  i also got a static shock from my fishing pole and i dropped it in the grass. once the object passed everthing went back to normal.\n\nthe object i estimated had three equal sides approximately 250-300' long or more. it just cleared the tree tops to the nw so i had a perfectly clear look at it.  the brightness of the spheres illuminated the super structure.  i asked my grandfather if he knew of anything like that and he felt initally that it was some sort of structure being carried by a large helicopter.  a hellicopter that large wouldn't have made a sound like that and i would have know it instantly.  anyone from the nam who has heard a huey comig for miles knows the sound and it was pretty large to by hung from a bell of a chopper.  this sound was an electronic hum and was nothing like an aircraft.  i never saw it again but its bothered me my entire life.  i just like things explained and with some level of credability and understanding.  it was a and remains a mistery to me but perhaps someone has a solution or explaination.", "photos":

left of it and fading to the distance. it didn't head all the way left as the airplanes do that land at the airport. it especially caught my eye because it looked similar to two white lights i saw in that same direction last june and posted to mufon. these lights were not clearly unconventional, but an hour later, taking in groceries from the car to the house, hovering directly across the cross street were two bright lights that were stationary, with a helicopter flying underneath it. the helicopter could be heard, the \"plane\" never made a sound. after i looked at it for a few seconds just hovering there and the helicopter moving beneath it, another light appeared to the right and the object started to \"glide\" away in that direction. a red light then appeared and flashed in a non-discernible pattern. i watched the triangle of white lights with a red light in its middle slowly move away and the helicopter followed it. i could clearly hear the helicopter and no other sound but traffic when it passed close by. ironically, or synchronistically, the june sighting already mentioned also included a triangle that flew over my house a short while after i had seen the object or objects with two white spheres. also, this monday night, my friend at my house and i heard rumbling off and on throughout the evening. after the sighting it got loud enough that we could feel the rumbling indoors and went outdoors to investigate. in the direction that the triangle object was hovering in when i initially saw it, it sounded as if jet engines were rumbling during takeoff when hearing that as an observer close to the ground by an airport when the planes take off. i doubt they were jet engines because the sound would usually build up then suddenly stop as if the engines were literally shut off, but if a plane were making the sound it should have faded away. the lights and sounds monday night were strange. i've included two images i created from pictures i've taken of

however, this object came towards me from a high angle in the sky which thereby caused me to dismount the camera and take hand held pictures. while taking pictures of it, i saw with my eyes through the camera viewer it appearing to be perfectly spherical in shape, dullish gray color with a hint of black color. it did not appear to emit light; however, it did appear to reflect city ambient light.  from my best estimates in size via experience with camera shots at that distance, i would estimate the size of object-1 similar in size to a large weather balloon size but not the shape of it.  viewing it with no camera but with eyes only:  the object-1 appeared to be at a high altitude, traversed slowly typical of a satellite or drifting balloon heading east, barely noticeable in the sky until spotted, no audible sound were heard. duration of object-1: 46 seconds starting at 20:41:31.  object-1 never changed in shape or in light intensity throughout the entire observation of it. pictures were taken (no tripod); faint light can be seen upon adjustments of lighting in photo program. \n\n  object-2 similar to object-1. heading: south east. duration: 65 seconds starting at 20:55:58. object-2 never changed in shape or in light intensity throughout the entire observation of it. pictures were taken (no tripod); faint light can be seen upon adjustments of lighting in photo program.\n  \nobject-3 (possible satellite) 5 pictures were taken with a camera on a tripod until object observation was lost upon readjustment of camera view. no enhancements required except via d-lighting low. light characteristic of 1 second exposure is not typical to any known jet or plane light pattern.  object-3 had a level flight coarse, but interpretation of light characteristic is unknown at this time.  however from past observation of satellites with eyes only, object-3 appeared to be a satellite with minor fluctuation in light intensity. duration: 16 seconds starting at 21:00:46\n\n  object-4 (blimp size) was unquestionably an ufo of some sort in my opinion.  i first noticed the unknown object within a 1 mile range with my eyes only.  this object had no lights on it nor did the object emit any lights.  the size of the object is comparable for that distant of being an extremely large commercial jet, or comparable in size to a large c-31 military transport jet, or comparable in size of a goodyear blimp.  it was almost unnoticeable while traveling except it almost stand out from the background scenery as a large and dark, elongated object traversing very slowly in speed which the speed is very comparable to a blimp speed.  the altitude is estimated to be at the altitude of a blimp flying, or at the altitude of a landing-approach of commercial jet.  i had a difficult time trying to locate object-4 with my eyes while trying to locate object-4 through the camera's viewfinder since the viewfinder on the camera has a darken filter.  once i was able to locate it on the camera, what i saw quite literally sent chills down my body as being startled but not frighten,; yet,  i continue to take pictures of it with the remote. the object appeared to be a huge eye looking thing.  it is possible that it might be a blimp because of it elongated shape, but i doubtful of that.  at the ends points of the object, it appeared to come to a point similar to how our eyes come to a point at both ends.  a blimp is more rounded at those ends.  in the center of this object structure appeared to be a wavering, huge darken, circular-like mass area as in some similarities to the iris of a dark, color eye on a person.  outside the darken circular area but in the area that comes to a point, the color was of darken, yellowish color with maybe a hint of orange in it.  while looking at it through the camera, it appeared to me to have a mean-like look which that part is what sent chills down me.  i managed to take 4 pictures on the tripod before i completely lost sight of the ufo including searching with my eyes only.  only one pictures shows up with no enhancements required; plausibly, one of the search light from the light show that was taking place near my location possibly lit the object up which was pure luck for me. duration: 19 seconds starting at 21:15:34. pic-1 resembles (to some extent) the object which i saw through the camera's viewfinder. further cropping and resizing (pic-2) shows something completely unknown and bizarre yet enlightening in features as to being unique.\n\n  about 10 minutes later, a jet making the sounds similar to a fighter jet headed nw in direction towards the commercial airports but in opposite direction of the ufo's heading.  i took 3 pictures of that jet.  now i know how all this sounds with \"light show\" and \"eye looking\" terms used; however, this event did take place, and this is not a concocted or exaggerated event.  this is a true chronicle of the event and how it unfolded that night.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22640_submitter_file1__HugeUFO_actualsize.bmp", "http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22640_submitter_file2__HugeUFO_crop600x_fadeenhancment.bmp"], "lat": "33.41913", "sighted_at": "2010-04-04"}, "22647": {"reported_at": "2010-04-05", "lon": "-106.64504", "summary": "About 9:05, ****** and i were sitting on the patio when we saw something strange in the sky (see attached photoshop rendering).  it passed by roughly south to north.  it was low in the sky (mountain tops visible above it).  it was visible for probably less than a minute before disappearing beyond the neighbor's trees.  it made no sound.  it was difficult to determine the size or altitude, but if it was about 3000' agl (common altitude for airliners passing over our house), it was bigger than (and traveling slower than) an airliner.  i have to think it was low, because if it was higher, it would have been huge!\n\nit was very dimly illuminated.  in fact, it was difficult to see if you looked straight at it (center field vision is not good at night).  it almost looked like it wasn't directly lighted, but might have been illuminated by reflection of the city lights.

friend b's house.  around 9:30 pm we decided to go into town for the festivities, and since there were more than a handful of us, a few of us had to jump in the back of my buddy t's truck.  we were all laying down in the bed of the truck so that we wouldn't be pulled over.  it was myself, \"k\", \"b\", and b's brother \"c\", who were in the back of the truck.  \n\nas we drove along, we were all talking loud, looking around at different things as we whizzed along wilcox rd, when suddenly i hear \"k\" yell out, \"hey, i see a f---ing ufo!!\" and i was like, \"what? you're kidding,\" and i look up into the middle of the sky directly overhead and see this strange shape that at first reminded me of an angular cloud, in a kind of boomerang shape, but a cloud that was moving, and moving quite briskly.  it immediately clicked in my mind that this was not a natural object or a natural cloud.  it moved in a fashion that is impossible for a cloud, and there was not a natural cloud in the nightsky, it was completely clear out.  as my disbelief turned to awe i continued to stare at the object as it glided over our position in complete silence, and i saw that within the cloudy substance that flowed from the front of the object to the rear, was a geometric boomerang shaped object, with sharp lines, as if drawn by a ruler, contrasting against the background.  the cloudy mist-like substance seemed to spring forth out of nothing from the front of the object, and trailed over the rest of the craft towards the rear.  and as we gazed on in amazement for what was probably at most, 10 seconds, it approached the tree filled horizon, and that coupled with our turn on the road, took it out of our view.    \n\nwe could not believe our eyes, and started cursing a myriad of profanities uttering our complete amazement at what the hell just happened, and what the hell we just saw.  \"b\" and \"c\" had looked up a bit later than \"k\" and i, and had failed to see the geometric boomerang shape within the cloudy substance, but they did see the cloudy mist, in an angular fashion, gliding across the sky in a straight line briskly.  it had absolutely no sound at all, no lights, and moved in a completely straight line, in a direction that i believe was north or northeast.  we have no idea how big it was, only that it looked extremely large.  when talking about it with \"k\" later he told me that he held his hand up to the sky afterwards, with his pinky finger and index finger extended outwards, the others tucked in, in a sort of devil's horn you might say, and he felt like the distance between the two fingers pointing outwards was a good approximation of the wingspan of the strange object in the sky.  this however, really does not solve the qustion of just how big it really was, rather it only makes the argument for it being rather large.  if it was close to us in the sky, it was still huge as all hell, and if it was even higher up in the sky, then its size is even larger, almost mind boggling large. \n\nthis story is written with all honesty and complete truth.  both \"k\" and i had always believed in the possibility of ufos, but had never seen or experienced anything like this in our lives.  after talking about it more and more, we both feel like this is an event that has changed our lives forever.  to us there is no question about it: this was a real ufo, and it was not of this earth.  there is absolutely nothing manmade out there, not the stealth bomber, or anything, that can match up to what we saw that night.  immediately the following day after seeing the object, i began to research online what sightings of ufos were out there that met the same description, and i came upon a sighting of a ufo seen over belville, texas, in september of 2009, case number 19343.  the article describing the ufo fit our description perfectly in almost every detail.  the way it was described to be moving, that at first it seemed to be a fast moving cloud, but not a cloud at all, the way it looked, and the way it glided across the sky in a straight line.  after reading this i knew that this was the exact same craft we saw, and that we were not alone in witnessing such a spectacular object. \n\ni will forever be changed by this.  let people judge me how they may, but i speak the truth.  this is what i saw, and i was not alone in seeing it.  something is out there.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22911_submitter_file1__UFO001.jpg"], "lat": "40.18466", "sighted_at": "2010-04-18"}, "22402": {"reported_at":

left and drove back down 375 and pulled off the road just about a mile past mailbox rd. i believe the time may have been approximately 9:00-10:00 p.M. (pst). in one of the videos my wife mentions 12:00 central time; this was the end of the sighting. i parked the vehicle at more or less a forty-five degree angle to the road with the headlights pointed towards the glow of las vegas in the sky. this glow also illuminated the mountains and landscape (silhouette etc.). \n we had pulled off the road to see the stars in the remote sky; we were not there to catch a sighting (13 years married with no break from the kids-type trip). we were in a hurry to get back to vegas but decided to stop along 375. we initially left the car running and lights on with my wife sitting in the passenger seat. i left the car and came around to her side and proceeded to watch the horizon. once we both saw how many stars there was i told her to turn off the car and step out with me. we had both been standing there for just a few minutes trying to get both the digital cameras and the video camera to pick up what we saw. just then i noticed a bright object (not a shooting star) high up in the sky headed towards vegas. \n this object was very small or very high but did not exhibit normal characteristics of a plane. there were no flashing strobes or sound from engines etc. this object being small, and disappearing quickly, did not really grab my attention. however, moments later from the same direction the object disappeared from came two lights flashing. they seemed motionless and as if they were affixed to each other. in other words it seemed that they were attached by a bar or direct line etc. they flashed for a while before i even considered pointing the camera at them. there are many cattle crossing lights of similar color along 375. it finally dawned on me that those lights had to be miles away and could not possibly be the same type of lights; these lights were much brighter and intense. \n i pointed the video camera at the objects and could not pick them up until i turned on night shot. the two larger lights were very visible; in addition to this were two other smaller lights that could not be seen with the naked eye. we watched these objects move from left to right going in the direction of rachel. as the two primary objects (po) moved in this direction you could see other smaller lights moving around them. they would zip from one point to another. as they shot away their illumination would dim. in all probability, there were probably more objects out there than we captured or even saw. i based this on the fact that after watching the video, you can see objects you could not see with the naked eye.  \nthe po traveled from the direction of vegas until they were almost perpendicular with 375 before we lost sight of them. we waited for a few more minutes and then decided to leave. we had only gone about a mile or two when my wife screamed \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdthere they are again\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. this time the po were only a few miles from us (i am guessing about this, their contrast in the night sky made this hard to tell but they were definitely very close to us).  in the video i try to use the ground as both a reference and to help make the camera focus as it should. as you will see in the video, based on the ground etc. it seems that they were right on top of us but i could not figure out why we were not being dowsed by the light. also, i did not see any report of this light on the ground. it was as if the light did not travel or radiate like normal lights. this was very strange for something so bright and intense.\nthe po made very slow movements. the additional smaller objects seemed to jet around the larger ones and were more agile.  in one of the videos i think i see something like electricity or sparks coming from the po. now the strangest thing was that the po seemed to merge with each other right before they \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdblinked\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd off or out. also, strange is that i heard my wife say they are gone but she says this at least a second or two before they \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdblink\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd out again on the camera (not sure why there was a delay between her eyes and the camera). in the stills there seems to be a structure present.  \nas far as feelings went, i think we were just in amazement of the objects. when they reappeared closer to us the second time i think we were both a little frightened. it seemed to be checking us out. we got a little more worried about the remote location and the fact that there were other objects moving around the po. i do believe that if we stayed there, the objects would have come closer. i had no feeling whatsoever that the event was over with when we left. these objects were clearly doing something related to that general locale. we decided to leave based on the fact that each time the lights went off, they came back on closer. \n\ni am not sure how to answer the radio button at the bottom of this screen. what third parties are you referring to?  all i am really seeking is if someone knows what these images are and just how close they were to us. i will submit the videos after speaking to someone in person via phone.", "photos":

i went in the house to get binoculars and it was gone. i got in my car and drove to a point a block away where i could see it again. i watched it through my binoculars for about 5 minutes or so. it changed shape the whole time i watched it, about a mile or so away (i guess)and forty feet long (i guess), but it was hard to tell if maybe it was farther and bigger. it wasn't closer i'm sure. i thought maybe it was a weird balloon or something twisting and rotating in the wind, but it wasn't anything like a hot air balloon or aircraft that i have ever seen, and didn't seem to be moving anymore. i drove to get a closer look and it was suddenly gone, so i doubt it was a balloon, because it had vanished while i was driving towards it. it was there one minute and gone the next. i didn't

"summary": "In the evening of 4/6/10 at about 8:45 pm, i was in the kitchen of my home in carlsbad chatting with my brother. i had just spent the entire day visiting legoland with out of town relatives. it was a very beautiful, warm day that day, so the night sky was very clear and we decided to draw the blinds open, and slide open the patio door to let some fresh night air in. we were just enjoying our beautiful open view of carlsbad from our backyard which faces palomar airport. it is quite commonplace to see planes landing and taking off, even at that time of night. at about 8:45 pm, my brother and i were standing in front of the kitchen window which also faces the backyard. my brother suddenly asks me if i've ever seen a ufo. i thought it was a bit strange of him to ask because we were chatting about a whole different topic at the time. as he was asking me this, i saw him gazing out towards the kitchen window and so i looked out the same way. what i saw were 2 diamond shaped objects very brightly lit, a very golden yellow color. my first thought was they were 2 airplanes in a holding pattern waiting to land at palomar airport. i initially dismissed my brother's sighting of the 2 objects as airplanes and i quickly looked away. however, i quickly looked back since he was still staring out there all this time, and i took an even closer look to see that the objects did not look like planes after all. in fact, in addition to not really looking like airplanes, they were quite large in comparison to the real airplanes in the air at the same time. they were just suspended in air and not really moving anywhere at all. this i found very strange. as my brother and i were coming to realize that we were actually looking at a ufo, the objects instantly disappeared from view!\n\nthen, about 15-20 seconds after that, they reappeared again, but this time as 4 diamond shaped objects with the same brilliant glow and golden yellow color. this time they were in formation, sort of like a parallelogram (slanted square formation). by this time, i called out to my husband who was in our bedroom and also to my daughter who was in another room, to come outside to the backyard to view this strangely beautiful sight. so all of us were standing outside my back lawn viewing this light show which was out of this world, nothing like any of us has ever seen. i felt a bit scared, very excited and in awe, all at the same time. i did not want to keep my eyes away from the light formation in the sky, for fear it would disappear once again. \n\nthis ufo light show went on for about 2 minutes. the objects did not move anywhere, again they were merely suspended in the sky, glowing and staying in their slanted square formation. i still don't even know exactly how far away they were from us. i believe one of the \"diamond\" shaped objects faded a bit and then appeared again brightly during this timeframe. at the end of the light show, the lights simply \"turned off\" and we no longer could see the objects. it was as if someone had just turned off the light switch. they had literally disappeared!\n\ni captured only one picture shot of

thought to scan the skies for a ufo. (i often scan the sky for anomalies so that i might increase the chances of actually seeing one.) well, i got what i was looking for. as soon as i looked up, i saw what looked like a black circle floating in the sky. the object immediately caught my attention because of it's foreign appearance. the circular object was approximately half the size of a dime from my perspective and made no noise. i gazed at the object for a few seconds wondering what this object could be before i called out to greg. after hanging up, greg stood beside me and said \"what is that?\" the object then began moving down and to the right in an erratic motion. the flying object then moved in front of a cloud. this is where things really get strange. at this point, i thought the black on white contrast would give me a more defined visual of the object. however, the object seemed to be changing in shape. i felt as if my brain had a hard time grasping the true shape of the object. the object seemed to flatten out into an elliptical shape and even split in two at times, then coalesced in less than a second. once the flying object moved past the cloud, it dissipated. since it was st. patrick's day, we thought that this object could have been a huge balloon, but that doesn't really make sense if you consider that it moved down, changed shape, and then disappeared. \n\ni am attaching two photos of

plane, this is not a meteor or space junk or satellite or anything else like that. \ni have been seeing this craft for about 5-6 years now, here in wisconsin. it appears as a bright, white ball of light, and sometimes, a lot of times, it will fade out gradually and disappear completely, and then re-appear, sometimes getting larger in size. it basically sits in one spot, just \"hanging\" there in the air, moving slowly up and down, left and right, around and around, sometimes fast. it always seems pretty close. a lot closer than stars or airplanes. \nsometimes, right when you look at it, it will disappear, as if it knows your watching it and/or is playing around.\nit does not have any other lights on it, it is just one big ball of light. it hovers above the woods sometimes and sometimes in the fields, or the horizon. i live in the country, outside of platteville. i will see it very low on the horizon sometimes when the sun is going down. i have seen it during the middle of the day a couple times.\nmy mother and little sister are the only other persons that i know of that have seen it. i'm sure other people around platteville have seen it, because of how often i see it, but i'm not sure.\nshe(they) has only just seen it recently though(mom,sis), january 30th, of 2010. we were on our way to shullsburg, wisconsin, taking my younger sister to a friends house. it was around 4pm, so it was still light out. i'm not sure which direction we were driving, but as always i was just kind of eyeing the skies and spotted it and pointed it out to her. i have told her about it before, and she has never doubted me but is the type to have to see something to believe it, and she couldn't explain it herself.  \n\nwe pretty much observed the object the whole time on the way to shullsburg, with it sometimes disappearing for a while. on our way back to platteville we only noticed it peeping out a few times until we got close, then it appeared, it was near our airport, and i noticed a plane or jet flying up towards it, climbing higher and starting to go faster and closer to it. me and my mom were both observing this as we were coming into platteville. when the jet/plane got right to it, the craft disappeared completely. the jet/plane then slowed down and descended, right then the craft re-appeared in the same spot. \nwe were both pretty stunned by this, and i was very excited because i've always heard of this type of sighting, when a jet or plane chases a ufo but have never seen it until now. \nthe ufo i see though, i have not really heard any similar type of ufo craft. not as bright and close, and fading away and re-appearing. i see it very often. what made me first notice the craft, 5-6 years ago, would just have been me watching the skies, as i have always had an affinity for ufo's. when i see the craft i don't feel frightened or any negative effects, they aren't here to do any harm, i do not believe. \nthe photo's i have included are of the craft. \nthis is what happened when i photographed it. \ni cannot explain it, it's not like this before or after i take the photo or when i'm looking through the lens, it's strange and i don't

"summary": "I was sitting on my covered front porch reading alien agenda ( really no joke) and i stepped off the porch to look for my dog.  i looked up and saw a gray reflective horseshoe shape object about 100 feet above me.  the object moved very slowly and seemed to disappear into the night, it was very dark gary, sort of reflecting, but hard to tell due to the night sky.  i had been reading this book and had a pen in my pocket and drew it in my book as i stood there. at first, i was stunned, was it my imagination?  i looked harder, i did not see it approaching me, it was just there and then moved slowly over me, very slowly and i was astonished it was so low to the ground.  i knew it was not like anything i had seen before, i live about 15 miles from will rogers intl airport.  but it wasn't a flight path normally used.  it seemed to be crawling over my head over the edge of the house and where i was standing about 10 feet from the porch.  i thought maybe it was a blimp, but did not have that shape, the horseshoe shape was clearly defined as was the two round fan shapped objects at the end of each side of the horseshoe that i seemed to be able to see thru.  as it was going slowly, over me i could see the sky thru the vent things.  the reflective surface was gray but the edges were sort of fuzzy, it seemed to reflect my house lights.  i brought it up at a mufon meeting a month later (i am a member) that 2 other people (also mufon members-a couple) had seen it the same night and and agreed that my picture i drew in the book was accurate.  i believe them because, while we were discussing things at the meeting, prior to my mentioning it, i showed the drawing to a the wife member sitting next to me.  she stated she had seen that and asked me to show her husband was standing at the back of the room.  i did and they both discussed the date, i had not told them the date yet, and they confirmed my date.  i believe they said there were others with them when they saw it.  i reported this out loud to the group with the dirctor there.  it is not like anything i have seen before, 200 feet long  and 50 feet wide with a chunk out of the center about 1/3 of the way in from the end that gave it a horseshoe look.  at the tip of each horseshoe was a round fan with blades (or thats how i perceived it) that i could see through to the night sky.  i had enough time to draw it as it moved over my head, about 2 minutes. i looked up after drawing it one more time and good not see it any longer.  in my excitement, i did not notice  if it made noise that i could hear at the time, but upon memory i could swear it made a very quiet humming noise.  i am submitting this as a mufon member of my own accord, no one had prompted me at the time to record this event. maybe it is an ifo because the state director at the time did not ask me to report it or do an interview to document the event, he did not approach the other couple either that i know of.  by the way the other couple was in tulsa area, i am in mustang, just west of oklahoma city.  that is a very long distance, over 120 miles away seen on the same night by me a mufon member and them also mufon members, what's the chance of that!    i do have several other sightings  to record.  maybe they are not ufo's.  military maybe but not like anything i have seen.  but that's what i (we) saw.  i showed the drawing to 2 family members who work in aviation navigation and also military air traffic control and it was unfamiliar to them.  i will notify our new state dirctor that i filed this report.  i originally drew it with pen, but after trying to make a picture of it by hand, i decided to see if i could get the image of the surface to show on a paint program.  this is very close to what i saw.",

camera for last christmas, which she never uses, it was still in the box (dead battery, etc, etc) so i had to plug into the outlet on our porch for power and i started shooting, i had never used that camera before so i was figuring it out as i shot the footage.\n\nalso my daughter had been telling me for a few months now that she had seen a strange looking object several times and would come to

strange events on camera.What appeared to be black spheres of energy started to do unexplained movements and sounds.This would go on every few days,and when i noticed something different i made sure

in turn powers the main craft, to open the\" gate\" for inter dimension transfer.Other craft and forces are able to come and go when it's\nopen.I knew from the very first sighting, that this must be recorded every second that i saw something,so i could study it more closely. since this started, i have lost most friends and people that respected me. i cant talk about making contact, or waking up

the benefits \nof a black hole but no side effects. how cool, we are about one hundred years behind, so we need to take this more serious.Contact is real not like the movies always but through telepathic mind sensory communication.If you you tube \"footage of a real black hole\" by mr.Wildrhino, you will see just the first part of the film it actually seems to collapse or die.You will see

seen grazing the small hills of green pastures, landscaped by a stretch of wild flowers along side the road as we traveled to our destination. we did make a few occasional stops to take a few photos, being that both of us enjoyed the hobby of photography.\nwe stayed at at the secret river lodge at the yearling restaurant,14531 east county road 325,in hawthorne,fl which is just down the road where

morning we planned out our day, which consisted of traveling to a few small towns, which were only, minutes away. we traveled to ft.Mccoy, eureka, mcintosh and salt springs.Along the way we stopped for a few yard sells, art shows and exhibits which seemed to be numerous for that weekend. saturday night we walked across from our cabin and ate dinner at the yearling restaurant, which consisted of two sides, catfish, frog legs, soft-shelled crab and hush puppies. then we settled back to our cabin for a good night\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds rest. \nsunday morning we awoke around 8:00 am, we made ourselves some coffee and then we took our cups of caffeine down to the creek, which were only a few yards away from our cabin. we sat down upon a bench, sipping our coffee as we listened to a variety of birds sing their own melody and watching the dragon flies dance across the tops of the water. it was a nice morning, it was breezy and overall an overcast day. i sat my coffee down upon the bench and started snapping photos of my surroundings. i then began to walk under the cross creek bridge, which was to the right of where the bench was and snapped a picture of a mirrored reflection of some cypress trees in the water. then went back to our cabin, packed up our things, went into micanopy shops and then headed back to jacksonville, fl.\nwe arrived back to jacksonville, fl around 4 pm and i was anxious to view the photos of which we had taken during our trip. i had taken a total of 298 photos and my boyfriend had taken a total of 136 photos. after uploading the photos, we began watching a slideshow of our trip on my computer. i remember making comment to him about how pretty the reflection was in the water and then he questioned me \" what\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd? and then he pointed to an object on my monitor screen towards the tops of the trees. to be honest at first i thought maybe it might have been a bird but the closer we looked, it convinced us both

section of richmond, virginia.  i noticed the craft during beautiful weather and clear skies at approximately 6:30 p.M. while walking east down riverside drive on the south bank of the james river.  i was casually scanning the scenery and wildlife along the river, gazing northeast toward the north bank of the river and greater richmond.\n\nthe cigar-shaped craft, perhaps the length of a football field, appeared to be a dull metallic fuselage with light and dark sections fore, aft, and amidships.  there was no writing on the craft or standard markings, no advertisements like you would expect on a blimp, and it did not appear to be a conventional blimp, derigible, or zeppelin of which i am familiar.  \n\ni did not see any fins, stabilizers, rudders, or conventioal propulsion systems.  it was not a balloon, plane, or helicopter. i did not hear any noise coming from the craft.  there were no lights of any kind (at first), no faa port/starboard (red & green) navigation (running) lights, no headlight and no tail light, even though most conventional aircraft would be required to have such lights turned on during dusk hours, especially while operating at extra-low altitude for safety reasons. \n\nthe cylindrical ufo was hovering low, at perhaps 1,500-2,000 feet, over what i believe was an affluent section of richmond.  i used a tall bell tower(spire) at richmond's dogwood dell carrilon (maymont park) as a point of reference.  from my location during the sighting, the tower is a few miles downriver on the northside of the james river, and the cigar-shaped ufo was hovering perhaps .25-.5 mile inland from the river maybe 1-3 miles west of the carrilon bell tower, perhaps over historic agecroft hall.\n\nwhen i saw the craft, i stopped in my tracks and scrutinized it for a couple of minutes, trying to determine whether it was an unusual blimp or cylindrical ufo of possible extraterrestrial origin.  having relatives at nasa, nsa, a late uncle who once was president of the vietnam helicopter pilot's association in washington, d.C., and having myself seen apollo 16 (saturn 5b) liftoff from cape canaveral, a u.S. air force atlas centaur rocket launch, and having been on naval ships and attended the largest airshow in the u.S. three times, this large cylindrical object hovering low near the james river caught my eye.\n\nafter watching the ufo hover silently for about one minute and not seeing any lights, a bright clear-white strobe light of intense magnitude suddenly flashed one time.  the duration was very brief, a couple of seconds.  then no lights for maybe 10-15 seconds.  then another intensely-bright strobe flashed for a couple of seconds except this time the color was red.  these were the only lights seen during my approximate 10-minute viewing.  the two strobe lights flashed from the underside of the ufo at amidships.\n\nmaybe a minute after the strobe lights flashed, the craft suddenly turned slowly on its axis at maybe a 45-degree angle of rotation and then remained motionless in its new position for the remainder of my viewing.  it was as though the occupants of the craft knew (perhaps telepathically) that people on the ground were observing and thus shifted the position of the ufo in order to say \"hi.\"\n\nat this point, i pulled out my cell-phone, activated camera mode, and centered the viewing screen on where i knew the ufo was, but i could not see the ufo on the camera screen because of the long distance, and my phone cam does not zoom, and having photojournalism training, i decided to not take a picture believing that the distance was too far for the camera's capabilities.  the ufo was a couple of miles away on the other side of a wide river during evening hours, etc.  too bad the ets didn't zoom in (across the river) and give me a better photo-op.\n\nat this point, i continued my walk east down riverside drive while keeping the ufo in view when it was not obstructed by foliage on the river bank.  a couple of minutes later, i came to a parking area on the banks of the river near the pony pasture river park.  i saw a solitary man (white or hispanic) in his 20s or 30s sitting indian-style on a large granite boulder in the river a few feet from the bank.  the man seemed to be gazing intently across the river, up into the air, in the directon of the cigar-shaped ufo.\n\ni figured the man was watching what i had been watching, and he was facing away from me and did not know that i was there, so i kept quiet and did not disturb his moment of mystification.  i watched the man eyeing the ufo and the cylindrical craft itself for perhaps one minute, and neither man nor mysterious machine moved a muscle or flinched an inch.  finally, i continued my walk toward home, leaving the man solid as the giant rock that he used as a stool in a pool.\n\nin addition, be advised that some dark unmarked black-hawk helicopters were flying around my area the same day and evening (4-30-10) which has happened during and after previous ufo sightings in my area.  there also was at least one military fighter plane that made a noisy pass at low altitude and high speed which is very unusual, so maybe the government was monitoring and/or chasing the ufo which seems to be par for the course in the united states and canada.\n\nlater that night, friday, april 30, 2010, i was prompted to visit mufon's website and was surprised to see a supporting ufo report from a man named jim in rustburg, virginia which lies 11 miles south of lynchburg and 111 miles southwest of richmond.  jim reported a cylindrical (cigar-shaped) ufo of identical description.\n\njim was much closer to the craft than me, however, and was able to see detail that was harder for me to discern because of the distance during my sighting.  jim's sighting occurred at 6:47 a.M. and my sighting was farther east at about 6:30 p.M.\n\nbetter still, jim was a professional witness and said in his mufon report, case # 23052, that he was an ex-army and navy career man with a naval-intelligence background and \"studied all types of conventional and unconventional aircraft.\"\n\n\"i'm in the army national guard and have seen uav aircraft in iraq, this was different,\" jim said.\n\n\"this object had no fins or wings visible of any type and no engines visible. it was simply a straight cigar or cylinder shape with some object below it or attached to it. it had no rotors or wings and made no noise. it moved slowly and straight. this was absolutely baffling,\" jim added.\n\nafter seeing jim's report and telling my friend, josh, who, with his wife, saw a green sphere/tear-drop ufo descend over south richmond (chesterfield county) in november 2009, i decided to file my own mufon report to perhaps lend more credence to the report from jim in rustburg, va.  \n\nfurthermore, other reputable witnesses, including scientists and government employees, have seen and reported cylindrical and disc-shaped ufos downriver from richmond near the surry nuclear-power plant and also near the north anna nuclear power plant on lake anna in central virginia.  \n\nmy wife and i, and tens of thousands of others, also saw numerous green-sphere ufos descend along the east coast in march 2009.  richmond's daily newspaper, the richmond times-disptatch, ran a cover story which mentioned the lights and accompanying sonic booms but did not investigate adequately and failed to connect this to simultaneous ufo reports aired on tv stations in tidewater virginia.  \n\nthere are numerous mufon reports on file about these sightings.  bottom line: more and more ufos and ets are being seen everyday and everywhere, and each individual must draw their own personal conclusions as to why.\n\nattached are two photos of cylindrical ufos that look similar to the ufo that i saw over richmond, va on friday, 4-30-2010.  the first photo synchronistically features a ufo that was farther east over the ocean off virginia beach, va on august 9, 2009.  the second photo was taken by members of c-seti (center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence) a little farther south off the coast of north carolina's outer banks in april 2009, one year earlier than mine and jim's sightings in central and southwestern virginia.  the c-seti members say they \"contacted\" the extraterrestrials aboard the cylindrical ufo.\n\nnote:  i cropped and enlarged the image of the cigar-shaped ufo over va beach which made the craft more visible but also resulted in pixel distortion around the object because of the extreme magnification, but this distortion is to be expected.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/23080_submitter_file1__CylinderVABeach8-9-09enlarged.JPG",

and when he said \"triangle shaped,\" it got my attention quickly. he said it was moving extremely fast, much faster than anything he had ever seen before, and covered the sky in 2 or 3 seconds. it made no sound and traveled in an arching motion like it was following the curve of the earth. he estimated that it was at least 10,000 feet up, maybe more. he also said it had to be quite large due to the altitude and relative size when compared to the stars. it was traveling from north to south towards tarentum/harmarville area. i asked him if he could sketch it and he said he could. he described the huge light on the bottom of the craft, and the outside edges were lit along the entire length, and several large lights in the back. the lights seemed blurry/hazy, and left sort of a streak, but he figured it was due to the extreme speed. i went to his house the following weekend and brought along several print-outs of triangle craft since he had never seen a photo of one before. he was amazed to see how close his drawing was to others. to this day, he said he still doesn't believe in ufos, but he is sure that what he saw was not any type of known airplane or military jet.\n\ni re-sketched the craft based on his drawing, which was on a torn out line piece of paper, so i figured it would scan clearer if i re-did it. the main difference to note on this craft is the lack of lights at each point. all of the lights were white and had no blinkers. i am hoping someone else out there has witnessed this type of craft, especially the extreme speed. he told me that if he didn't happen to glance up at just the right moment, he would have never seen it.", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/23130_submitter_file1__Triangle3-6-2010.pdf"], "lat": "40.62304",

the 19th of march i was outside smoking when i looked up to orions belt. if i wasnt looking at that exact spot, at that exact time, i would not have seen this thing or things flying past. i have seen them on three nights in a row, with a friend for a witness and to help see what it/they are. here is how i describe it.....\n   on the first night (3/19)this craft or thing flew almost overhead, from south to north, silently. there were no lights, but you can see that they are like grey-ish \"v's\" or things flying in a formation or attached to a black object.\n\n the first sighting (3/19)i noticed them underneath what seemed like a flat rectangle that was very dark. they passed overhead rather quickly and flew in a straight path out to the horizon. the next day i told my friend what i had seen, and the next night (3/20) we both watched for them at the exact same time, which is 9:35. i had a camcorder running, but recorded only our audio due to blackness. but you can tell just what is happening as we see this thing!\n\n  would you beleive that he spotted these things, or this one thing with silver/grey \"v's\" under it, passing over before i did! i was glad to have a witness, and a second pair of eyes. we traced it till it got to the dark part of the night sky where we lost it. it took about 6 seconds to cross the open sky and pass out of our sight. about two minutes later my friend spotted it (or a second one) flying verticle to its original path. i did not catch that pass though. we were, and still are stumped! but there is still more to tell you about our ongoing sightings!\n\n so, lastnight, (3/21) my friend and i met once more and we had the best sighting yet! \n\nthis mass of about five or so \"v's\" in two very close but offset formations, passed directly overhead! one mass formation had several \"v's\" in it, and flew very close to one anther while the second formation had only two \"v's\" in it. these looked like one big formation though, all passing over (silently and w/0 lights) all at the time, and these \"v's\" did not drift at all between each other. they were just one five peice big mass passing silently over our heads. we lost sight as it again entered the darker part of the sky. after a couple of minutes the formation containing two \"v's\" flew over in the oppisite direction, same path though. my friend had returned inside though, so only i saw that.\n\nyou will not even notice these things if you are not looking for them! you need to look up towards orions belt, for them moving from the south to the north. they are quick and silent and hard to see on account of they have no lights at all.\n\n  i had been relating this to a local astromoner via the web, after each night of seeing this thing in hopes of getting an explanation from him.I hope he joins us soon, as he says he wants to and he has an interest thus far, and night vision gear too.\n\nwe have sketches too, and the audio recording from the second night. we are trying to get someone, anyone, everyone, that wishes to catch a look at this object to come right here in biddeford, maine and see it for themselves. i will point it out myself, if it passes over. my email is [cms/tg/pid] and i want to find out what we are seeing very bad. i will help you get here, and put you right where you will see them if they pass overhead. they are very strange and

slower too. it was a bright white tube with rounded edges. no wings, or marks or anything on it. it flew in a perfect straight line and held a very steady speed. somehow there was something really calm about it. i don't know. i really concentrated on what i saw, and heard, but it didn't make a sound. there was no sound at all! earlier today i had heard the first plane in days, and remembered that to listen for it when i saw the object, but it was completely silent. it's a very quiet neighborhood, so there wasn't much noise at all.\n\ni compared it to some birds as well, but it was too calm, the steady speed, and the straight line, no shaking or swinging.\n\ni thought of a balloon too, but a balloon would've been affected by the wind and it's direction and speed would vary.\n\ni've never seen a blimp here, and it was too small and had no propulsion of any kind as far as you could see.\n\ni would think that it's extremely unusual for me to see a ufo in the couple of minutes that i'm outside my work in this small town here in south norway. there's nothing interesting or significant here. the chances are one in a billion i'd think... but still, it really made an impression on

the passanger seat at this time, while a friend drove me home. my mother was upset i was coming home late, so i ignored what she was saying to me and instead looked out the windshield at a slight angle towards the driver's side. in the sky, across from alvarez rd (in between rio grande,tx and roma, tx)i saw a bright white light, a perfect sphere.  my first reaction was: \"oh my god!! what's that!?..Oh my god..It's moving!!..It's f*king moving!\" while the driver still drove at 55mph-60mph, i kept track of the object for about 3seconds. the object was not far up in the sky, but instead it seemed to be pretty low to the ground. i saw it moving down towards the ground as if it were going to land. it moved downward in the shape of an arc, a movement i believe no airplane or helicopter do when they plan to land. anyhow, i do not know if the object landed because i lost site of it once it got too low to the ground because of trees covering the site. i noticed there was a house near where the object was, but there may be more than just one. the driver did not see what i saw, but i wanted to ask people around the area where i saw this object if they had seened something similar to my story but i was too scared of doing that for fear of being called crazy.  what made me first notice the object was its perfect sphere-shaped bright-white glow. when i first saw it, i didn't think anything of it; until i saw it was actually moving downward as if to land, i thought it could be perhaps a ufo because of the way it moved downward, forming an arc path. during the siting i felt in disbelieve; it was very unexpected because i was not looking at the sky to find strange things, but yet there it had been very tangible. while still on the phone with my mother, i told her what i had seen: the bright white light shaped as a sphere. after the sighting when i got home, i asked myself what it could have been and started iliminating possibilities and i could not find an explanation

than 3 minutes. basketball size object\n\n  i was outside smoking a cigarette and drinking a cup of coffee while looking out towards the sky when i saw coming from the west a solid, round and pure light about the size of a small basketball.  at first, i thought that it might be a plane; however, this also looked very similar to what i saw back in april of 2003.  thinking that maybe it was just a plane but possibly that ball of light, i continue to watch it.   i first spotted it about a mile or two away from me. it was at an altitude of about 100 feet.  it was still twilights (stars could still be seen) and the sun was still below the horizon. i kept watching that the ball of light thinking. \"my how familiar that looks.  probably plane's light?\"  i kept looking to see if there was any change in the light such as flickering, and i was listening for any kind of sounds of a plane, but i didn't hear no sounds.  just when the ball of light was just upon me of almost 100 feet away, i realize that this was no plane or  jet except only one thing, and one thing only!  it was that ball of light that i saw back in april of 2003! the first thing i thought, \"now here is my chance to get that picture of that ball of light which i couldn't get back in april 2003, and to see finally what that ball of light really is by zooming on it with the 300mm adjustable telescopic lens. maybe there some structure in it or around it that i can't see with just my eyes.\"  i ran inside the house, grabbed my camera, check the settings on the camera to make sure it was on night mode, then i ran back outside onto my porch. then i zoomed onto the ball of light,  and i focus the lens manually, then i began taking pictures.  i wanted to get every possible pictures i could get until i could no longer see the ball of light, or until i was no longer able to follow it.  i took many pictures from the porch until the ball of light object started to get out of my view because of tree branches.  i then ran through the house with my camera still in hand.  i came to spot in the middle of a sidewalk, and i began taking many closes up pictures, and i zoomed out once or twice for size comparison.  thankfully, there was enough light out during the dawn hours which i was hoping that the shutter wouldn't take too long to close.  but at the time, i thinking the shutter was taking to long to close.  i wanted a whole bunch of pictures, but the camera was just taking too long for  each picture shot.  there was a couple of times when a tree branch was almost blocking a clear shot of it, so i move over slightly to a different spot in order to get a clear shot of the ball of light.  i just kept taking pictures hoping i was focusing the lens clearly so the pictures wouldn't turn out  fuzzy.  i was also thinking , \"do i have enough time to set up the tripod?\"  i quickly decided against that idea.  i was also going to use the auto-focus, but i decided against that because it is unreliable in a quick situation which it takes up valuable time. [from camera experience taking pictures at night.]  any pictures of that ball of light ufo was better than no pictures, and i wanted all the pictures of it as i could possibly get of it. eventually,  a big tree got in the way of me seeing it, and it seem that the ball of light was just getting dimmer and dimmer as it travel away from me (smaller in size too.)  possibly, because of the direction the ball of light took was near in direction where the sun would eventually come up.  i moved over to a spot where i thought where it might pass through an open area to view it which the ball of light should not had taken too long for it to reach that area.  but i never did see it after waiting for it about a minute.  at that moment, i thought \"maybe it was getting too dim, and that's the reason i can't see it.\"  then i thought, \"well, maybe i could see it on the computer if there was any light still being emit by the ball of light. \"  so i took 3 more pictures, but i still didn't see that ball of light once it went behind that tree.  i then thought, \"maybe it instantly disappeared like that first ball of light. [april of 2003].\"  i went back inside the apartment, and i looked at the clock to see what time it was, then i noted that time down.  i saw my compass laying on the desk, so i decided to take a compass bearing of that ball of light route which was at 45 degrees of 360 degrees (almost north east).  this ball of light that was seen in mesa, arizona is identical to the ball of light i seen in pensacola, fl back in 2003. identical in shape, in light, in speed, and in altitude.  identical. this observation i just had was much closer than the first observation back in 2003 which i filed a report to nuforc back then.  i had a really good look of it. i saw no out lines of any structure for a ball of light to be attached.  it was simply a ball of light very similar to a globe.  unquestionably, it definitely look like it was a solid sphere, not just a light.  it almost seem like i could almost reach out and touch it; being, it was that close.  it was actually awe inspiring to observe this little ball of light just silently and slowly traversing through the air with it being bright yet gentle enough as to a soft glow to allow me to intensely gaze at it for every little hints of details that it may have for me to see.\n \n  since 2003, i been searching on the internet for any logical explanation of what that ball of light may be.  in the past week, i seen maybe several ufo objects, but i started to discount them as being ufos. then last night when i was watching 1 video on youtube showing ancient ufos depiction,  i was giving reason to every depictions why they were not ufos since it could also be intercepted in a different way.  now this may sound a little odd, but i was actually going to start thereafter showing some of my pictures on youtube.  pictures i took over the years, and give reasons why some pictures that other people took may be just birds, or planes, or whatever because there was a logical phenomenal reason for each one, and how some other people's photo may have these kinds of phenomenal occurrences in their pictures.  in another words, i turned on my views to that of  ufos were not real because i didn't see any real hard evidence except for only pictures as possible proof.  and maybe what i saw back 2003 was just something of a fluke created by the  military with their new invention or contraptions.  however, this morning,  i awoke up from a dead sleep at 5:00am which i normally don't get up that early.   i figured, since i up, i make some coffee, then i just go outside to drinks some coffee and smoke a cigarette.  i was probably no more than a couple minutes outside when i saw this ball of light.  now this all sounds very incidental, but i was going agree with some of those people out there that ufos are not real, but this morning quite literally and instantly reminded me again about the facts that  ufos are indeed real.  no questions or doubt about that; they undeniably and truly do indeed exist.  i have pictures of that ball of light now, unquestionably those pictures shows somewhat as evidence as to the  fact that there are ufos possibly extraterrestrial in origin.  and there is very good chance that somebody saw that same ufo too in the phoenix area this morning.  the question is: are they going to come forward maybe onto this site to say, they saw it too.", "photos":

and many,many times i have seen \"spheres\" which always take on the color of their surroundings..If they are in or near clouds they will appear white and if they are in the clear blue sky they will appear transparent but discernible if you continue to look closely enough..\n\nby doing this i have led a few people to see these craft when they otherwise didn't even believe in ufos..\n\ni have witnessed ufo activity several times with the chemtrail phenomenon and this time i was armed with a camera.\n\ni didn't see anything like i normally had previously but i did notice a faint object the shape of a \"bell\" directly above which seemed to be out of the path of these aircraft's pattern..I grabbed a pair of 10x binoculars and i picked up on the object so i pointed my camera in that general direction and started snapping images and i was able to capture a triangle/bell shaped object.It was stationary for several minutes before disappearing. i started to go inside and i felt like i should stay out for a few minutes more..That i hadn't seen enough and that if i went inside i would miss the craft if it returned or appeared in another part of the sky..\n\nfinally after about 3-4 minutes,i thought it was over when i began to get an feeling of being watched and i heard in my mind \" turn around and look at me\" and i caught it just before it disappeared..It is beyond my ability to understand...But i believe with all of my heart.. i was basically told \n\n\"hello,here i am!!\" like i was a participant in a game of \"hide and seek\"\n\nthis is not the first time i have been absolutely \"compelled\" to look at a direct spot in the sky and had a ufo sighting..\n\nso i just i started snapping pictures indiscriminately and that is when i captured the faint sphere when i pointed my eyes in the certain point in the sky..\n\ni have seen several ufos while watching the chemtrail activity in this area..I live in the appalachia mountains directly on a mountain top that is part of a state park with one part being very high bluff which overlooks the major city in this area and it has been a perfect spot to watch much aeronautical activity..Including lots ufos.\n\ni only recently purchased a camera..But i have seen many,many ufos since being in this area..\n\nthese are only the images i have of this report..I have a few others but these were the first since i began filming and they were daylight captures..\n\nthe first image is a copy of the original and the second is a copy of the image with different color filters which bring out the craft from the background color of the sky..\n\nthe third image is of the craft that appeared and in my mind i was compelled to look and there it was observing me..It wanted me to see it!..Otherwise i would have continued looking in the other direction..\n\nthey have not been altered and are real..\n\ni had to turn nearly 180 degrees to catch the craft in the third image after it compelled me to look in that direction..\n\ni offer a little info about my background..I have held a high level security clearance for the dod and worked in intelligence with one of america's top tier defense contractors and i used to be a deputy sheriff.\n\ni need to know why this is happening..\n\nthis event happened just like reported..There are many more and i think there is a reason for them..I am hoping to find out why!!..Maybe you can help me..", "photos": ["http://www.mufoncms.com/u2/files_jeud8334j/22749_submitter_file1__TriangleUFO-Copy.JPG",

northwest. it was perfectly round and the size of the sun (maybe slightly smaller), but we had no idea how far away it was. it rolled very slowly across the sky, horizontally from right to left (from northeast to southwest), and was trailing orange flames behind it. the ball was engulfed in flames too and the \"rolling\" motion was very clear. if my memory serves, we also heard a deep roar coming from it. i remember watching it for as long as we could; it was at least a minute because it rolled very slowly. we were both saying to each other that we had never seen anything like it before and had no idea what it could be. it was eventually out of sight; i can't remember if it disappeared beyond the horizon or behind mountains. the time was near sunset but there was still a good amount of daylight. we were both shocked by the experience and went inside and continued to talk about it and what it could possibly have been.\n\nas the years went by, i remember telling the story many times

west at the constellation of orion when i heard a brief \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdscreech\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which i was viewing. thinking it was an owl i quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  at first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  it was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. it was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that i could hear.   as it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  it was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. there was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions had a very faint glowing quality to them.  as it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  it looked completely flat like it was a projection.  it began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. the total event lasted around 8 seconds.\ni have my master\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds degree in

is possible that i was seeing a \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdsecret aircraft\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, i am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  i would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though i could be way off.   once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. the measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  it all happened very fast and was short in duration, making it difficult to be definite on measurements.  all in all, i saw a craft without doubt and i am perplexed by what i have seen.", "photos":

spent the last hour before dusk, planting beans and peas in our plowed field.  i had just finished for the day and was standing at the ne corner of the field, with a clear 360 degree view of the sky.\n\ni was observing a few stars barely discernible above me when something made me look to my south.  suddenly a bright white/orange light appeared, then 4 more next to (east of) it.  the four came on all at once.  they all blinked off at the same time.  these lights were approx. 10 degrees above the southern horizon.  they lights only appeared for a few seconds each time.\n\ni ran to the house, yelling for my husband to \"come quick, ufos!\" (i didn't know what they were at the time, still don't). i grabbed my binoculars and by the time we got to the field, the lights were gone but as we stood there, a light appeared, then 3 more in a loose triangle formation.  they all blinked out at the same time, then slightly further east they all appeared again.  each time they blinked out, they would appear a bit further east until i could no longer see them because of the treeline.\n\nmoments later, we saw at least 1 jet flying into that area and it was tiny in comparison to the lights.\n\nafter the lights were gone, my husband said, \"what is that?\" he pointed up at about 65 -70 degrees ese and said, \"watch that star, it's moving.\"  i watched it through the binoculars.  i told him it was probably a satellite but then the object did something that satellites do not do, it altered course from ene to due east and then a few moments later, it disappeared.\n\ni contacted robert powell (mufon) and described what i had seen.  we discussed it and he sent me a video of flares he had taken sometime earlier.  my husband (a military aviation veteran) and i watched the video.  the flares in the video did not resemble what we saw tonight.  my husband is adamant that what we saw were not flares and i do not believe they were either.\n\nevidently we were not the only ones to see these lights tonight.  i have a blog called \"lights in the texas sky\".  a short while ago, someone posted to my blog what they also saw this evening and it matches very closely to what joe and i saw.\n\nhere is their report/comment:\n\n\"tonight 3/31/10 around eight thirty pm we saw about 10 flashing lights. it would appear for about 1-3 seconds as a bright orange light, dissapear for about the same time, then come back. but when it reappeared, rather than there only being one there would be multiple. this is about our forth time to see these things and we only see them at night but they are always the same thing. an orange light that flashes a few times then dissapears and we dont see it again the rest of the night.\" \n\nif i hear back from the poster, i will send any information to mr. powell.\n\ni am including in this report, 3 depictions of what joe and i saw.\n\nthank you, sw.", "photos":
